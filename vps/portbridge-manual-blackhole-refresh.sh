# #914: keeps portbridge's manual (operator-triggered) blackhole list current
# -- the dashboard-side companion to portbridge-blackhole-refresh.sh's own
# maltrail feed. Same shape as that script (poll on a timer, download to a
# temp file, atomic rename), pointed at the dashboard's own export endpoint
# instead of GitHub. See docs/dashboard-manual-ip-block-design.md decision 4
# for the full reasoning: the VPS PULLS this list, on a timer, over the
# WireGuard tunnel that already exists (home is reachable at 10.8.0.2,
# docs/CGNAT-DEPLOYMENT.md) -- no new inbound channel to the VPS, which is
# deliberately the more exposed, internet-facing box.
#
# Opt-in via the same "blackhole" compose profile portbridge-blackhole-
# refresh.sh already uses -- a deployment that doesn't run that profile is
# unaffected, exactly as before this addition.
#
# Downloads atomically (temp file + rename) so portbridge's own mtime-based
# reload (blackhole.go's readOne, which reads a source file only after Stat
# shows its mtime moved) never observes a partially-written file.
#
# #3403: this default URL was a path the dashboard does not serve, and the
# failure was invisible. The frontend answers an unknown path with an auth
# redirect, so `curl -fsSL` exited 0 on a 200 whose body was a login page
# rather than a list: every 300 seconds this loop replaced a working
# blocklist with nothing, logged a cheerful "updated (0 addresses)", and
# operator IP blocks never reached portbridge. Three things changed:
#
#   * the default is the route that actually serves the export,
#     /api/v1/ip-block-export (backend-service's ip_block::export), reached
#     through the BFF's /bff/* proxy -- the same seam
#     scripts/github-ci-runner/dashboard-source-health.sh already uses to
#     call the Rust tier from a shell. Redirects are deliberately NOT
#     followed, so a 307 is visible as a 307 instead of quietly fetching
#     whatever it pointed at.
#   * that route is auth-gated (require_service_token, #2183), so the
#     request carries the dashboard's shared service token --
#     DASHBOARD_SERVICE_TOKEN, the same value the home stack maps to
#     SERVICE_TOKEN -- in an X-Service-Token header, handed to curl through
#     its stdin config (-K -) so the secret is never in argv, never in the
#     container's process list, and never in this script's log. Unset is a
#     loud refusal, not an unauthenticated attempt: the unauthenticated
#     answer IS the bug.
#   * a download is written only after it is proven to be a blocklist: HTTP
#     200, a non-empty body, a text/plain content type, and every
#     non-comment line an address. Anything else -- a 404, the
#     307-to-/auth/login, a 0-byte 200, an HTML login page -- is refused
#     with a named [E-*] marker and $dest is left exactly as it was.
#
# That last point deliberately REVERSES this script's original "no
# minimum-count sanity floor" rule. An empty manual list (no IP has ever
# been manually blocked) used to be written as a legitimate empty file;
# after #3403 it is indistinguishable, over the wire, from a broken fetch,
# and that ambiguity is where the bug lived. The safe direction is the one
# this script already took for a download failure: keep the last known-good
# list and say so, loudly, on every interval. A genuinely empty list is
# still harmless -- blackhole.go treats a missing file as "no blocklist yet"
# -- and the first non-empty export replaces the stale one anyway.
#
# A refusal is loud but never fatal: this is a 5-minute loop, so a homeserver
# that is briefly down (or restarting) must cost one skipped refresh, not a
# sidecar that never runs again.

# never disagree with what the file contains.
#
# The address field is hex digits, dots and colons rather than a dotted quad
# on purpose: readOne's gate is net.ParseIP, which also accepts IPv6, and
# ip_block::set_block parses an IpAddr and the export emits the stored string
# verbatim. An IPv4-only check here would refuse the WHOLE export over one
# IPv6 entry, which stops every operator block being delivered -- #3403 again,
# wearing a fix's clothes. The classes are POSIX ones only, and no bounded
# repetition is used: this runs on busybox grep inside curlimages/curl.
