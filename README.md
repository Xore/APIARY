# A multi-service honeypot and automated malware-analysis stack

A full honeypot deployment that follows this repo's CGNAT pattern: the sensors
run at **home under Arcane**, publish only on the WireGuard interface, and are
exposed to the internet **through the VPS** — HTTP via Traefik, everything else
raw-tunnelled with a port bridge.

This is a public repository: copy the example environment files locally and
never commit real addresses, credentials, captures, payloads, or sandbox images.

```

**All core sensors run without compose profiles.** The only profile is the
optional on-demand `geoip-update` maintenance job. 33 deployment pieces —
33 independent Arcane-managed stacks at home plus the VPS (see
[docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md](docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md) for how a repo commit
reaches the live host, and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for
why the home side split into this many Compose stacks):

| Piece | Runs on | What |
|---|---|---|
| `honeypot-keycloak` ([arcane/home/honeypot-keycloak/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-keycloak/compose.yml)) | **home** | Arcane-managed Keycloak/PostgreSQL identity stack; only Keycloak is reachable from VPS Traefik over WireGuard |
| `honeypot-init` ([arcane/home/honeypot-init/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-init/compose.yml)) | **home** | one-shot bootstrap jobs: log paths, Elasticsearch templates, Arkime schema, persona validation |
| `honeypot-cowrie`, `honeypot-dionaea`, `honeypot-conpot`, `honeypot-dnp3`, `honeypot-http`, `honeypot-multipot` (`arcane/home/honeypot-<name>/compose.yml`, one directory each) | **home** | the sensors: Cowrie, Dionaea (+ TFTP relay), Conpot personas, DNP3, HTTP/API honeypots, multipot |
| `honeypot-dicompot`, `honeypot-dns-honeypot`, `honeypot-citrix`, `honeypot-cisco-asa`, `honeypot-rdp`, `honeypot-endlessh`, `honeypot-beelzebub`, `honeypot-hellpot`, `honeypot-elasticpot`, `honeypot-galah`, `honeypot-sentrypeer`, `honeypot-wordpot`, `honeypot-mailoney` (`arcane/home/honeypot-<name>/compose.yml`, one directory each) | **home** | more sensors: DICOM medical-imaging decoy, DNS UDP reflection bait (response-capped, never a real amplification vector), Citrix ADC/NetScaler Gateway decoy (CVE-2019-19781), Cisco ASA WebVPN+IKE decoy (CVE-2018-0101), RDP decoy, SSH pre-auth tarpit, vendored multi-protocol deception runtime (SSH/LDAP/MCP/HTTP, #1418), vendored HTTP bot tarpit (#1419), vendored Elasticsearch decoy distinct from multipot's own (#1423), vendored LLM-powered HTTP honeypot behind its own broker-guarded bridge onto the shared Ollama instance (#1420), vendored SIP/VoIP fraud-detection honeypot (#1424), vendored WordPress/CMS decoy (#1421), vendored SMTP honeypot taking over port 25 from multipot's own retired handler (#1422) |
| `honeypot-canarytokens` ([arcane/home/honeypot-canarytokens/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-canarytokens/compose.yml)) | **home** | self-hosted honeytoken platform (#1426) -- planted-artifact deception, not a listening protocol decoy; `canarytokens-adapter` translates its webhook alerts into this repo's shared JSON event shape. The dashboard's Settings > Canarytokens pane (#1487) creates PDF/Word/Excel/custom-image/Windows-Folder/QR tokens on demand for use *outside* this honeypot; see [docs/dashboard-canarytoken-creation-design.md](docs/dashboard-canarytoken-creation-design.md) |
| `honeypot-tanner` ([arcane/home/honeypot-tanner/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-tanner/compose.yml)) | **home** | SNARE + TANNER application-emulation boundary |
| `honeypot-elk` ([arcane/home/honeypot-elk/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-elk/compose.yml)) | **home** | Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana, EveBox, Arkime |
| `honeypot-ip-enrichment-worker` ([arcane/home/honeypot-ip-enrichment-worker/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-ip-enrichment-worker/compose.yml)) | **home** | networkless worker that moves the portbridge `via_port` → real attacker IP join from dashboard read-time to ingest-time, writing `logs/enriched/*.json` for Filebeat |
| `honeypot-agent-intrusion-worker` ([arcane/home/honeypot-agent-intrusion-worker/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-agent-intrusion-worker/compose.yml)) | **home** | correlates sensor/Suricata events into campaigns, scores them against deterministic criticality rules, writes the `agent-intrusion-campaigns` index the dashboard's `/agent-campaigns` route reads |
| `honeypot-attacker-identity-worker`, `honeypot-correlator-worker`, `honeypot-payload-inventory-worker` (`arcane/home/honeypot-<name>/compose.yml`, one directory each) | **home** | three more workers that had their own top-level compose file but had drifted out of the deploy/installer inventory before #1502's audit caught it (same class of gap #560 and #891 each fixed once before) -- attacker-identity correlation, cross-sensor campaign correlation, and payload inventory tracking |
| `honeypot-dashboard` ([arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/compose.yml)) | **home** | the live investigation dashboard (Go), plus its in-progress TanStack Start/Rust replacement (`dashboard-next`/`backend-worker`/`backend-service-mounted`, #1608) -- feature-complete but still `next`-profile-gated, not yet live; see [#1628](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/1628) and [docs/DASHBOARD-CUTOVER.md](docs/DASHBOARD-CUTOVER.md) |
| `honeypot-dashboard-backend` ([arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard-backend/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard-backend/compose.yml)) | **home** | `backend-service`, the modernization port's single-instance request/response tier, split out from `honeypot-dashboard` by #1622 -- same `next`-profile/not-yet-live status |
| `honeypot-payload-analysis` ([arcane/home/honeypot-payload-analysis/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-payload-analysis/compose.yml)) | **home** | payload dedup + YARA scanning |
| `honeypot-utilities` ([arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/compose.yml](arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/compose.yml)) | **home** | autoheal, log rotation, disk-space monitoring, reporting |
| [`vps/`](vps/) | **VPS** | Traefik, portbridge raw tunnels, Suricata, WireGuard HTTP bridges, and isolated Keycloak OIDC gateways |

Every stack above is a directory-aware Arcane Git sync driven by
[`arcane/manifests/home-production.json`](arcane/manifests/home-production.json)
-- see [docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md](docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md) for the sync
model, cutover procedure, and confirmed platform limitations.
`honeypot-arcane` itself (the manager these syncs run inside) stays
installer/`deploy.yml`-managed rather than becoming a self-referential sync
-- syncing the thing that has to already be running before any sync can
happen would be a bootstrap loop.

Six more home-hosted stacks are Arcane-managed the same way but keep their
existing repository-root path instead of moving under `arcane/home/`, since
they were already self-contained and are cross-referenced by CI/the
installer at those paths:
[`auth-events-worker/`](auth-events-worker/),
[`llm-worker/`](llm-worker/), [`ml-worker/`](ml-worker/),
[`analysis/ghidra/`](analysis/ghidra/), [`sandbox/ghosts/`](sandbox/ghosts/),
[`pihole/`](pihole/).

The root [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) is an empty marker kept
only so `docker compose config` has something to validate against in this
directory — it is not itself an Arcane-managed stack and isn't counted
above. [`docker-compose.sandbox.yml`](docker-compose.sandbox.yml) is a
per-detonation Windows gateway/capture Compose file the sandbox brings up
and tears down around a single run; it's likewise not a standing stack.
ML, LLM, the Windows sandbox, and CAPE run their own independently managed
services outside this count — see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
for where those fit.

## Containment & safety — read this

The honeypot now runs **on your home network**. Higher-interaction sensors
(Dionaea captures live malware; SNARE/TANNER evaluate payloads) are genuinely
hostile-adjacent. Protect your LAN:

- Keep `HP_BIND=10.8.0.2` — sensors bind the WireGuard interface only, never the
  home LAN.
- The `honeynet` / `tanner_local` bridges have no route to your other stacks;
  **do not** attach them to anything real. Never mount the Docker socket.
- Ideally run this on a **dedicated host or VLAN** that can only reach the VPS
  over WireGuard, not the rest of your LAN. Firewall the honeypot host off from
  internal subnets.
- All third-party images (Dionaea, Conpot, SNARE/TANNER, ELK) need a live
  `docker compose pull`/`build` to confirm tags — verify against upstream before
  trusting them.
- Attacker IPs are personal data (GDPR) — keep logs access-controlled and
  short-lived.

> Prefer to keep attackers off your LAN entirely? Run this whole stack **on the
> VPS** instead: set `HP_BIND=0.0.0.0`, skip the `vps/` tunnel stack, and expose
> the ports directly. You lose nothing but the tunnel.
