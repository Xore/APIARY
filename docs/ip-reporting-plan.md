# IP Blocklist Reporting Plan

Report attacker IPs observed by APIARY to public threat-intel
blocklists via their APIs.

> **Status:** built. `arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/reporter/` (Go, not the
> Python layout sketched below --
> that part of this plan is superseded) is a real service in
> `arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/compose.yml`. Phase 1
> ([#68](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/68)) and Phase 2
> ([#69](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/69)) are both closed.
> Phase 3-4 (reputation validation, operator observability) is
> [#153](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/153), closed and implemented:
> `arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/reporter/greynoise.go` implements the Phase 3
> GreyNoise validation, and
> `arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/reporter/metrics.go` implements Phase 4's
> observability counters
> (attempted/suppressed/dryRun/sent/failed) as a JSON snapshot — a
> deliberate deviation from the Prometheus sketch originally proposed below.
>
> **Reporting is outbound and irreversible.** An abuse report cannot be
> unsent, and it names a third party's address from this stack. The reporter
> ships dry-run by default (`REPORTER_LIVE`/`ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` both unset)
> and stays that way until live reporting is separately approved — a
> standing constraint on this feature, not a Phase 1 convenience.
>
> This is *defensive* reporting (get an attacker's IP blocked elsewhere) --
> deliberately kept separate from *offensive/research* community threat-intel
> sharing (contributing this stack's observations to a shared corpus other
> researchers draw from), which was evaluated and declined; see
> [`community-threat-intel-sharing.md`](community-threat-intel-sharing.md).

## Goals

- Report every IP that touches a honeypot sensor to one or more blocklist feeds
- Deduplicate: never report the same IP twice within a cooldown window
- Respect rate limits of each upstream API
- Run as a lightweight sidecar container (`reporter`), tailing sensor logs from
  the volumes the stack already writes
- After keys are set in `.env` and dry-run output has been reviewed, no
  per-report human step

---

## Target Blocklist APIs

| Service | API | Free tier | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AbuseIPDB** | `POST /api/v2/reports` | 1 000 reports/day | General abuse, SSH, HTTP scans |
| **Blocklist.de** | `POST https://api.blocklist.de/api` | Unlimited | Traditional fail2ban-style reporting |
| **GreyNoise RIOT** | Read-only free tier | — | Cross-check before reporting (avoid FP) |

Primary target: **AbuseIPDB** — widely used, has a public confidence score, and feeds back into many firewall blocklists automatically.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Sensors["Cowrie / Dionaea / Conpot / HTTP-honeypot / DNP3"]
    Reporter["reporter (Go)<br/>hp-reporter, dry-run by default"]
    AbuseIPDB["AbuseIPDB"]
    Blocklist["Blocklist.de"]
    GreyNoise["GreyNoise RIOT<br/>(read-only pre-check)"]

    Sensors -->|"JSON event logs on the shared Docker volumes, tailed —<br/>not Redis pub-sub; see 'Resolved design decisions'"| Reporter
    Reporter -->|"POST /api/v2/reports"| AbuseIPDB
    Reporter -->|"POST /api"| Blocklist
    Reporter -->|"GET /v3/riot/{ip}"| GreyNoise
    AbuseIPDB -->|optional| Blocklist
```

The `reporter` container:
- Watches the same log/event volume already mounted by the `analysis` and `ml-worker` containers
- Maintains a local SQLite DB (`/data/reported.db`) to deduplicate IPs per service per 24 h
- Exposes a `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus) so Grafana can graph reports-per-hour

---

## Log Sources per Sensor

| Sensor | Log path (inside container) | Event format |
|---|---|---|
| cowrie | `/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json` | JSON lines |
| dionaea | `/opt/dionaea/var/log/dionaea/` | JSON / SQLite |
| conpot | `/var/log/conpot/` | JSON lines |
| http-honeypot | stdout JSON | JSON lines |
| dnp3-honeypot | stdout JSON | JSON lines |
| snare/tanner | tanner REST API | JSON |

All sensors already write structured JSON. The reporter will tail these files (or consume Redis events if the stack is extended to pub-sub).

---

## AbuseIPDB Report Categories

Map honeypot events to [AbuseIPDB category codes](https://www.abuseipdb.com/categories):

| Honeypot event | Category codes |
|---|---|
| SSH brute-force (cowrie) | `18` (Brute-Force), `22` (SSH) |
| Telnet login attempt (cowrie) | `18`, `23` (IoT Targeted) |
| HTTP scan / exploit attempt | `21` (Web App Attack) |
| Port scan (multipot/conpot) | `14` (Port Scan) |
| Malware download (dionaea) | `20` (Malware) |
| ICS/SCADA probe (conpot/dnp3) | `14`, `15` (Hacking) |
| DNS abuse | `11` (DNS Compromise) |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Reporter Container (week 1)

1. Create `reporter/` directory with:
   - `reporter.py` — main event loop
   - `Dockerfile` — slim Python 3.12 image
   - `requirements.txt` — `requests`, `watchdog`, `prometheus-client`
2. Logic:
   ```python
   # Pseudocode
   for event in tail_logs(SENSOR_PATHS):
       ip = event["src_ip"]
       if not recently_reported(ip, service="abuseipdb", window_hours=24):
           categories = map_to_categories(event["type"])
           abuseipdb_report(ip, categories, comment=build_comment(event))
           mark_reported(ip, "abuseipdb")
   ```
3. SQLite schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE reports (
     ip TEXT NOT NULL,
     service TEXT NOT NULL,
     reported_at INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Unix timestamp
     event_type TEXT,
     PRIMARY KEY (ip, service, reported_at / 86400)  -- 1 report per IP per day
   );
   ```

### Phase 2 — Blocklist.de Integration (week 2)

- Add secondary reporter for Blocklist.de using the same dedup logic
- Blocklist.de uses a simple HTTP POST with `server`, `ip`, `logs` fields
- Useful for SSH/FTP/SIP — feeds European ISP blocklists

### Phase 3 — Pre-report Validation (week 3)

Before reporting, cross-check against:
- **GreyNoise RIOT** (`GET /v3/riot/{ip}`) — skip known benign scanners (Shodan, Censys, security researchers)
- Local whitelist file `reporter/whitelist.txt` — your own IPs, Tor exits you want to skip
- RFC 1918 / loopback / link-local guard (never report private IPs)

### Phase 4 — Observability (week 4)

- Prometheus metrics from `reporter`:
  - `honeypot_reports_total{service, category}` counter
  - `honeypot_report_errors_total{service, error}` counter
  - `honeypot_dedup_skips_total` counter
- Add Grafana panel to existing dashboard: "Reports sent this week" bar chart
- Alert webhook (existing `HONEYPOT_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`) if AbuseIPDB rate limit is approaching

## Docker Compose Addition

Add to `docker-compose.yml`:

> The block below is the original sketch. It is superseded — see the status
> banner. Three things in it are simply wrong against what shipped, and are
> called out because they are the kind of detail that gets copy-pasted:
> there is **no Prometheus port** (Phase 4 emits `metrics.json` into the data
> volume instead), the Blocklist.de credentials are **`BLOCKLISTDE_SENDER` +
> `BLOCKLISTDE_API_KEY`**, not `BLOCKLIST_DE_EMAIL`/`BLOCKLIST_DE_PASSWORD`,
> and the live switch is `REPORTER_LIVE`. The `whitelist.txt` mount path and
> `REPORTER_COOLDOWN_HOURS` did land as drawn.

```yaml
  reporter:
    build: ./reporter
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY: ${ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY}
      BLOCKLISTDE_SENDER: ${BLOCKLISTDE_SENDER}
      BLOCKLISTDE_API_KEY: ${BLOCKLISTDE_API_KEY}
      GREYNOISE_API_KEY: ${GREYNOISE_API_KEY:-}   # inert unless GREYNOISE_ENABLED=1
      REPORTER_LIVE: ${REPORTER_LIVE:-}           # unset = dry-run
      REPORTER_COOLDOWN_HOURS: ${REPORTER_COOLDOWN_HOURS:-24}
    volumes:
      - cowrie_logs:/logs/cowrie:ro
      - dionaea_logs:/logs/dionaea:ro
      - conpot_logs:/logs/conpot:ro
      - reporter_data:/data
      - ./reporter/whitelist.txt:/config/whitelist.txt:ro
```

Add to `.env.example`:

```dotenv
# IP Blocklist Reporting
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=
BLOCKLISTDE_SENDER=
BLOCKLISTDE_API_KEY=
GREYNOISE_API_KEY=
GREYNOISE_ENABLED=0
REPORTER_LIVE=            # leave empty: the reporter is dry-run until set
REPORTER_COOLDOWN_HOURS=24
```

## Rate Limits & Throttling

| Service | Limit | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| AbuseIPDB free | 1 000 reports/day | Dedup per 24 h; batch high-volume periods |
| AbuseIPDB paid | 10 000/day | Upgrade if volume exceeds free tier |
| Blocklist.de | No hard limit; fair use | 1 report per IP per 24 h |
| GreyNoise free | 1 000 lookups/day | Cache RIOT lookups for 6 h in SQLite |

The reporter will track a daily counter and pause with exponential back-off on `429` responses.

---

## False Positive Mitigation

- **GreyNoise RIOT check**: if `riot=true` → skip (known benign scanner)
- **Minimum event threshold**: only report after ≥ 3 events from same IP within 10 min (configurable)
- **Whitelist**: `reporter/whitelist.txt` — CIDR and single IP entries, one per line
- **ASN filter**: optionally skip reports for IPs belonging to major cloud providers unless event severity is high

---

## Files To Create

The Python layout originally sketched here was never built — the shipped
service is Go. This is what
`arcane/home/honeypot-utilities/reporter/` actually contains:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ReporterDir["reporter/ (Go)"] --> MainGo["main.go<br/>entrypoint, run loop wiring"]
    MainGo --> RunloopGo["runloop.go<br/>poll tick"]
    RunloopGo --> TailGo["tail.go<br/>per-sensor log tailing"]
    TailGo --> EventGo["event.go<br/>normalised event"]
    EventGo --> CategorizeGo["categorize.go<br/>sensor/kind to upstream category"]
    CategorizeGo --> DedupGo["dedup.go<br/>SQLite-backed deduplication"]
    DedupGo --> GreynoiseGo["greynoise.go<br/>RIOT pre-check (Phase 3)"]
    GreynoiseGo --> WhitelistGo["whitelist.go<br/>CIDR/IP allowlist"]
    WhitelistGo --> BlocklistdeGo["blocklistde.go<br/>Blocklist.de client"]
    WhitelistGo --> ReportGo["report.go<br/>AbuseIPDB client"]
    GreynoiseGo --> ProcessGo["process.go<br/>report decision + dispatch"]
    ProcessGo --> ReportGo
    ProcessGo --> BlocklistdeGo
    ProcessGo --> MetricsGo["metrics.go<br/>counters to metrics.json"]
    ProcessGo --> AuditGo["audit.go<br/>bounded rotating audit log"]
    ReporterDir --> WhitelistTxt["whitelist.txt<br/>safe IPs/CIDRs to never report"]
    ReporterDir --> Dockerfile["Dockerfile<br/>FROM scratch, runs as 0:0"]

    DocsDir["docs/"] --> PlanMd["ip-reporting-plan.md<br/>this file"]
```

Every `.go` file has a matching `_test.go`. There is no `requirements.txt`,
no `sources.py`/`apis.py`/`dedup.py`/`metrics.py`, and no Prometheus
exporter — see the Phase 4 note in the status banner.

## Resolved design decisions

These were open when the plan was written. They are settled; the implementation
work they govern is tracked in
[#68](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/68) and
[#69](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/69).

- **Ingest via file tailing, not a message bus.** A Redis pub-sub channel has
  lower latency but adds a service to Compose for a reporter whose cooldown
  windows are measured in hours. Tail the logs; revisit only if `ml-worker`
  brings pubsub in for its own reasons.
- **Suricata IDS alerts are in scope**, alongside honeypot hits, from Phase 2
  ([#69](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/69)).
- **No auto-banning.** The reporter stays stateless and reporting-only.
  Firewall enforcement is a different trust boundary and a different failure
  mode: a false positive that costs an abuse report is recoverable, one that
  installs an nftables rule is not.
