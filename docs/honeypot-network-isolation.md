# Network Isolation

> **Status (2026-07-31):** rewritten. The previous version was an 850-line
> best-practice guide for a four-zone single-host lab — `virbr-mal` at
> `10.66.0.1`, `virbr-honey` at `10.67.0.0/24`, a `honey-dmz` and `analysis-net`
> Docker pair, and a management NIC on `192.168.100.0/24`. None of those exist.
> It also shipped five scripts as finished work (`firewall-honeypot-dmz.sh`,
> `firewall-malware-analysis.sh`, `firewall-analysis-stack.sh`,
> `zone-crossing-alert.sh`, `isolation-audit.sh`) that were never written.
>
> The `analysis-net` name in it is where

## 1. The actual shape

There is no single honeypot host. There are two machines and a tunnel, and that
split *is* the primary isolation boundary — the exposed services and the
analysis stack are not on the same hardware.

| | VPS | Home server |
|---|---|---|
| Faces | The public internet | Nothing. Outbound WireGuard only |
| Runs | Suricata on the public NIC, `portbridge`, the exposed listeners | The honeypot containers, Elasticsearch/Kibana, EveBox, Arkime, the dashboard, the sandboxes |
| Firewall | `ufw`, seeded by `vps/honeypot-firewall.sh` | No inbound exposure to reason about |
| Sees | Real attacker source IPs | Tunnel IPs, unless the record carries the original |

The consequence worth remembering: the sensor that sees the true source address
is the one on the VPS. See
[`vps/suricata/README.md`](vps/suricata/README.md) for the `HOME_NET`
trap that follows from it, and note that traffic arriving over the tunnel must
not be attributed to the WireGuard peer.

`vps/honeypot-firewall.sh` is the only firewall script in this repository. It is
deliberately small: it idempotently `ufw allow`s the raw OT ports that
`portbridge` handles, and does nothing else. Egress control on the VPS is not
scripted here.

## 2. Sandbox isolation

This is where the isolation has teeth, and it is documented in full in
[`kvm-network-traffic-analysis.md`](kvm-network-traffic-analysis.md). In short:
two libvirt networks — `virbr-sandbox` (Windows, `10.10.10.0/24`, gateway `.254`,
INetSim at `.1`) and `virbr-hpsbx` (Linux, no IP, no DHCP at all).

Neither has a `<forward>` element. That absence *is* the isolation — the Windows
network XML carries a comment block explaining it precisely because a later
reader "fixing" the missing NAT would be undoing the design. Two further
barriers back it up: the gateway containers sit on a macvlan marked
`internal: true`, and Phase 0 installs an iptables DROP pair across the bridge.

Guests carry the `honeypot-sandbox-strict` nwfilter — the real version of what
the old §4 proposed as `clean-traffic` plus a hand-written `malware-vm-strict`.
It permits ordinary IPv4/IPv6/ARP and blocks source-MAC spoofing and other
layer-2 protocols, which is what makes the per-MAC capture filter unevadable
from inside the guest.

## 3. Container isolation

Each honeypot's own compose file (`arcane/home/honeypot-cowrie/compose.yml`,
`arcane/home/honeypot-dionaea/compose.yml`, `arcane/home/honeypot-conpot/compose.yml`, etc. — split out
of `docker-compose.yml` under #258, which is now an empty stub) gives it its
own single-member Docker network (`cowrie_net`, `dionaea_net`, `conpot_net`,
`conpot_s7_1200_net`, and so on) —
[#235](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/235): the stack used to
put every honeypot on one shared `honeynet` bridge with Docker's default
inter-container communication, so a compromise of one honeypot had a direct
network path to every other honeypot. None of them need it — each writes to
a bind-mounted log file for Filebeat to tail, not to another honeypot or to
Elasticsearch over the network. The one real exception is `tftp-relay`, which
has `depends_on: dionaea` and actually forwards TFTP traffic to it, so those
two share `dionaea_net` instead of each getting their own.

`honeynet` is now the trusted analysis/management plane only: Elasticsearch,
Kibana, Filebeat, the dashboard, EveBox, Arkime, and `log-maintenance`. SNARE/
TANNER and its dependencies keep their own separate `tanner_local`, unchanged.

- `tanner_docker` is `privileged: true`. This is deliberate and should stay:
  TANNER's Docker-backed emulators need a daemon, and the design gives them a
  disposable nested one on `tanner_local` with `/var/lib/docker` on tmpfs
  rather than a bind mount of the host socket. The comment above the service
  says so; do not "simplify" it into a socket mount.
- No other container is privileged, and no honeypot-facing container mounts
  `/var/run/docker.sock`.
- `cap_drop: [ALL]` and `no-new-privileges` are on every honeypot now
  (`cowrie`, `multipot`, `http-honeypot`, `api-honeypot`, `dionaea`, `conpot`
  and its personas, `snare`, `tanner` and its dependencies, `yara-scanner`) —
  [#89](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/89) (SNARE/TANNER) and
  the per-service measurement passes referenced next to `dionaea`'s and
  `conpot`'s own `cap_add` lists closed the gap this section used to describe.
- `NET_ADMIN`/`NET_RAW` exist only on the three sandbox sniffers in
  `docker-compose.sandbox.yml`, a separate file brought up around a single
  detonation that must never be merged into `docker-compose.yml`.

## 4. Host posture

These are host-only procedures. They are real and worth doing, but they
configure a machine rather than ship as code — which is why there is nothing
here to implement and no issue to open. Verified by
`scripts/isolation-audit.sh` (#88), run as part of the
`.github/workflows/diagnostics.yml` `home` job.

- **sshd** bound to the management address only, never the honeypot-facing one.
  The check asks `ss -tlnp` for a port-22 listener, and it distinguishes the two
  answers that used to be the same one: "nothing is listening on :22" (`OK`) and
  "the listen address could not be read at all" (`UNMEAS`, fatal). `ss … |
  grep :22` exits 1 for both, which is why the audit does not use it.
- **libvirt socket** — `/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock` as `srwxrwx---
  root:libvirt`, and `listen_tcp = 0`. The TCP socket is off by default; the
  failure mode is someone enabling it while debugging remotely and leaving it.
- **AppArmor** profiles for `libvirtd`/QEMU enforcing, not complain. On Ubuntu
  these ship working; the risk is a profile dropped to complain mode during an
  unrelated libvirt problem and never restored.
- **Docker socket** never mounted into a honeypot-facing container. It is root
  equivalent — a container that has it has the host.

## 5. Declared stand-down

Freeing host RAM and CPU for a heavy leg is standing practice here: #3135
paused honeypot containers for a training run, and the sandbox VMs are a much
bigger claim on the same memory. The problem is not the stand-down. The problem
is that a stand-down and a broken host are *absence*, so the audit reported
both identically — `FAIL`, exit 1, no difference a reader could act on. That is
the "cries wolf on a healthy host" case, and it is the same defect as running
no check at all, because a run that is always red is a run nobody reads.

So absence gets a name, and the name is a dated declaration on the host:

```bash
sudo scripts/sandbox-standdown.sh declare \
    --issue '#NNNN' --until YYYY-MM-DD --reason 'why, in one line'
sudo scripts/sandbox-standdown.sh show      # ACTIVE or INACTIVE, with the reason
sudo scripts/sandbox-standdown.sh clear     # when the stack comes back
```

The file is `/etc/apiary/sandbox-standdown` (root-owned, `0644`, because the
audit runs unprivileged as `github-deploy-runner`; overridable with
`APIARY_STANDDOWN_FILE` for testing). While a live declaration is in force the
audit reports the sandbox objects it covers as `EXPECT` and exits 0, and it says
so out loud — owner issue, expiry, and the reason — in the body, in its footer,
and in the diagnostics ledger.

The declaration is deliberately hard to leave lying around, and every one of
these failures is itself a `FAIL` rather than a shrug:

| Declaration | Why it does not count |
|---|---|
| no `issue:`, `until:` or `reason:` | Nothing to hold the exception to a window or an owner |
| `issue: 1` rather than `issue: #1` | Not a reference. An exception nobody can be held to is the thing that rots into a permanent excuse |
| `until:` in the past | A window that has run out excuses nothing |
| `until:` unparseable | The window is unknown, and an unknown window is not a long one |
| `until:` more than `APIARY_STANDDOWN_MAX_DAYS` (14) out | That is a permanent posture change, not a stand-down, and it wants an issue and a decision rather than a file |

What a declaration does **not** cover, deliberately: anything that is present
and wrong. A libvirt network that exists and *forwards*, or an `ACCEPT` rule in
the `FORWARD` chain for `virbr-sandbox`, is a measured fault with a live
declaration in force — the exception is for absence, not for amnesty.

## 6. What the audit's labels mean

Every line the audit prints carries one, so a reader never has to count columns
or infer intent from a wording change:

| Label | Meaning | Exit contribution |
|---|---|---|
| `OK` | Measured, and it agrees with the invariant | none |
| `FAIL` | A measured violation, an exception that no longer applies, or a barrier that could not be read | **exit 1** |
| `EXPECT` | Absent on purpose, behind a live dated declaration | none |
| `UNMEAS` | The check did not run. Counted and named, never folded into a pass | **exit 1** for the isolation barriers |
| `WARN` | A triaged gap with a named owner issue, tracked and visible | none |
| `--` | Not applicable, or a note | none |

The footer prints the counts and one verdict line, so the answer to "is this
host safe" is the last line of the output rather than a reading of the whole
body:

```
isolation-audit: categories -- 0 unmeasured, 0 expected-by-declaration, 0 triaged gap(s), 0 fault(s)
isolation-audit: VERDICT PASS -- every check that could be measured agrees with the invariants (0 object(s) excused by a live declaration)
```

`UNMEAS` being fatal for the barriers is the load-bearing part. "The `FORWARD`
chain could not be read" and "the `FORWARD` chain is not DROP" are different
findings, and only the second one says the host is unprotected. Reporting
"could not tell" as agreement is the outcome that makes a check worse than not
having it.

## 7. Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| A rule matches nothing on the VPS | `HOME_NET` excludes the VPS public IP. See the Suricata README |
| Attacks appear to come from the WireGuard peer | The tunnel IP was taken as the source; the original address has to be carried through |
| Sandbox guest reaches the internet | Something added `<forward>`, removed the macvlan `internal: true`, or flushed the Phase 0 DROP pair. Any one of the three is sufficient |
| Host cannot reach the sandbox gateway containers | Expected — macvlan. Read the bind-mounted results directory instead |
| A honeypot container restarts after a hardening change | It needed a capability `cap_drop: [ALL]` removed. Add that specific one back; do not revert the drop |
