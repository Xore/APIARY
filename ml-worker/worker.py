    infinite polling loop.

    One event's failure (a non-numeric destination.port, any other shape
    extract_features() doesn't defensively handle) is caught, logged with
    enough context to diagnose, and recorded as a best-effort metric --
    never allowed to abort the rest of the batch. run_worker() advances the
    checkpoint after this returns, over the full `events` list regardless
    of which ones failed here, so a malformed event's position is always
    skipped past rather than being re-fetched and failing again forever
    (roadmap baseline: "bad events cannot stop a batch").

    session_tracker (#277): supplies real cmd_count/failed_logins_1h/
    unique_ports_1h, observed exactly once per event here and reused for
    both iso_model.extract_features() and lstm_model.score() -- optional
    (defaults to None, falling back to extract_features()'s own pre-#277
    neutral defaults) only so existing direct callers/tests that don't care
    about these three features don't have to construct a tracker.

    and this is where a single malformed event's own error is caught and
    isolated per event() -- see the module docstring above), but
    IsolationForest/HBOS scoring is now ONE batched call over every
    successfully-extracted event's features instead of one call per event.
    Confirmed live (see isolation_forest.py's score_batch() docstring) that
    the per-row path cost ~1000x more than the batched one for numerically
    identical scores -- this was ml-worker's actual classification-backlog
    bottleneck (#1227), not a capacity/hardware problem. LSTM stays
    per-event: its own per-IP sliding-window state is inherently
    sequential, and it's already cheap (~3ms/call) next to what
