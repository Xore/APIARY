"""
Shared model-lifecycle helpers (#65): version retention and metadata,
used identically by IsoForestModel and LSTMAEModel so the "last N versions,
metadata sidecar per accepted version" contract is one implementation, not
two independently-maintained copies.

The acceptance gate itself (holdout evaluation, anomaly-rate comparison)
lives in each model class, not here -- what counts as a valid holdout split
and how to score it is model-specific; only what happens to a file on disk
after a version is accepted is shared.

See docs/ml-worker-plan.md §11 for the full design and the reasoning behind
each constant below.
