# arcane-retry-failed-sync.sh — #2705: Arcane's gitops-sync endpoint has a
# ~5-minute hard deadline. When a sync's own redeploy step is still building
# an image past that deadline, the sync call itself 500s ("Internal Server
# Error", "Failed to perform GitOps sync") even though the directory sync
# (files on disk) already completed. The failure is not atomic: the stack
# directory ends up newer than the containers still running from it, and no
# status field reflects that drift.
#
# This script does not re-run the sync (that would just hit the same
# deadline again). It checks each named sync's lastSyncStatus and, for the
# ones that failed, calls the project redeploy endpoint directly -- that
# endpoint streams its own build/deploy progress over the HTTP response and
# is not bounded by the sync deadline, so it can actually finish.
#
# Read-only by default; pass --apply to actually redeploy. Safe to run
# repeatedly: a sync already reporting success is left alone.

usage: arcane-retry-failed-sync.sh [--apply] <sync-id-or-name> [more...]

Checks each named Arcane gitops sync's last sync status. Any sync whose
lastSyncStatus is "failed" gets its owning project redeployed directly
(POST /environments/0/projects/{id}/redeploy), which is not subject to the
sync endpoint's own ~5 minute deadline.

Environment:
  ARCANE_URL        Arcane API base URL (default: http://10.8.0.2:3552)
  ARCANE_BEARER     Arcane API bearer token (required)

Options:
  --apply     Actually redeploy. Without it, only prints what would happen.
  --dry-run   Explicit no-op mode (the default).
