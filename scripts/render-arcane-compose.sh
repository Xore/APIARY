#
# The one place that decides what honeypot-arcane's compose.yml looks like on
# this host (#3340). install-homeserver.sh's step_arcane_install and
# deploy.yml's "Synchronize honeypot-arcane" both call it, so a deploy can no
# longer write a different file than the installer did.
#
# #2950: the base compose is deliberately GPU-free -- Arcane's GPU-monitoring
# panel needs a hard NVIDIA device reservation, and Docker refuses to start a
# container with one when the nvidia runtime is absent. Arcane materializes
# every other stack, so it must start on a host whose driver is missing or not
# yet loaded. The overlay is merged only after a real GPU container ran, not on
# a flag: "GPU requested" and "GPU usable" differ until the driver's post-
# install reboot.
#
#   auto  merge docker-compose.arcane.gpu.yml iff the nvidia runtime works
#   off   base file only (installer with ENABLE_GPU_STACK=false)
#
# --no-interpolate matters: a plain `config` would resolve ${...} against the
# stack's .env and bake ENCRYPTION_KEY/JWT_SECRET/the OIDC secret as literals
# into a world-readable compose.yml.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: deploy.yml runs this inside docker:cli, which has no bash.
