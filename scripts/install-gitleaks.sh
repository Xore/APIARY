# install-gitleaks.sh -- put one pinned, checksum-verified `gitleaks` in front
# of the calling job. #3501.
#
# Same discipline, and for the same reason, as scripts/install-trivy.sh: every
# `uses:` in this repo is pinned to a full commit SHA, and a scanner binary
# is the same class of third-party code. Pinned version + checksum instead of
# the upstream install.sh curl-|-sh pattern (SAST-flagged, #3115) -- download
# the release tarball directly and verify it against a hardcoded sha256 before
# extracting anything. The checksum is the archive's own, carried here rather
# than fetched from a sidecar next to the download: a sidecar fetched over the
# same TLS session as the artefact detects transport corruption, which TLS
# already covers, not a compromised upstream.
#
# Installed into a runner-writable dir rather than /usr/local/bin: the
# self-hosted honeypot-ci runner has no write access to /usr/local/bin
# (install: Permission denied), and $RUNNER_TEMP is writable on both runner
# types -- the same constraint install-trivy.sh works under.
#
# Usage:
#   install-gitleaks.sh             install, then prepend the dir to $GITHUB_PATH
#   install-gitleaks.sh --print-path  install, then print the binary path
#
# Overrides (all three must move together; see the guard below):
#   GITLEAKS_VERSION  release tag, e.g. 8.30.0
#   GITLEAKS_SHA256   sha256 of the release tarball for that version
#   GITLEAKS_BIN_DIR  where to unpack (default $RUNNER_TEMP/gitleaks-bin)
#   GITLEAKS_BIN      use this gitleaks verbatim and skip the fetch (trusted as
#                     given; no version check is applied to it)
