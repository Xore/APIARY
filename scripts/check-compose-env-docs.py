"""Fail CI when a stack's compose.yml interpolates a variable its own
.env.example never documents (#1982).

.env.example is what a deployer copies when standing a stack up manually,
and what Arcane's project.env gets validated against -- it is where an
interpolated knob must be discoverable at setup time, not discovered at
first boot through a service refusing to start (ZEEK_PROXY_IFACE) or a
token platform quietly pointing at the placeholder domain
(CANARY_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME). Seven such undocumented variables shipped across
three stacks by 2026-08-26, purely by drift: honeypot-dashboard documents
60+ knobs meticulously while its newer siblings grew interpolated variables
faster than anyone revisited their (much older) example files. This check
is the mechanical version of the cross-stack contract review that found
them, so re-growing the gap fails CI naming exactly which stack forgot
which knob.

Two rules per arcane/home/<stack>/:

1. Every `${VAR[:...]}` interpolated by compose.yml must appear as a
   `KEY=` line in that stack's `.env.example`. Per-stack, not
   "documented somewhere else": each stack's file is copied on ITS OWN
   during manual stand-up, so a pointer to a sibling's docs defeats the
   purpose (that pointer is what dashboard-backend had for three of its
   four tiers' knobs).
2. Within any single `environment:` block, a key may not be listed twice.
   The original finding was two identical lines for
   ZEEK_PROXY_ATTRIBUTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS -- harmless until someone tunes
   line one and silently changes nothing.

Deliberately comment-aware: prose like "sh's ${VAR:-default} treats empty
as..." legitimately lives in compose comments, and stripping those lines
keeps documentation examples from being misread as interpolation (that
exact false positive exists in honeypot-utilities' compose). Shell-local
forms are skipped too: `$${VAR}` inside entrypoint scripts is container
sh, not compose interpolation.
