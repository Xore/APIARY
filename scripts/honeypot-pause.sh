# honeypot-pause.sh -- pause the pause-safe honeypot decoy stacks to free host
# CPU for a heavy benchmark or training leg, and resume them afterwards in
# strict reverse order with a real probe per stack (#3135).
#
# Why this exists. #3135 is a standing practice on this box: when a leg needs
# more RAM/CPU than the homeserver has free, pause the decoys, run the leg,
# unpause them after. The rules in the issue are hard, and three of them are
# interlocks rather than advice, so they live in code here rather than in a
# README nobody re-reads at 02:00 before a training leg:
#
#   1. Only pause containers classified pause-safe. A wrong "safe" does not
#      fail loudly -- it silently breaks a decoy that was carrying the honeypot
#      surface, so the classification is default-DENY: a stack that is not in
#      PAUSE_SAFE below cannot be paused at all, and the refusal says why.
#   2. NEVER pause ghidra-ollama-1 while a benchmark holds the GPU slot. The
#      GPU stacks are absent from the allowlist and additionally refused by
#      name, so a typo cannot reach them.
#   3. NEVER pause during the cold-run protocol. That protocol is governed by
#      STOP_WORKERS=1 + the restore trap in sweep_extra.sh and is deliberately
#      NOT touched here. We only refuse to run alongside it.
#
# Two findings from the 2026-09-27 dry run are load-bearing, and both are why
# this script is not a two-line "docker pause $(cat list)":
#
#   AUTOHEAL UNDOES THE PAUSE. Every decoy on this host carries the label
#   `autoheal=true`, and hp-autoheal polls every AUTOHEAL_INTERVAL=30s. A
#   paused container's healthcheck exec cannot complete, so Docker marks it
#   `unhealthy` and autoheal `docker restart`s it -- which unpauses it. Proven
#   on 2026-09-27: hp-elasticpot was paused at 18:12:21Z and autoheal logged
#       18:12:38 Container /hp-elasticpot found to be unhealthy - Restarting
#   17 seconds later, with the container running again and RestartCount still
#   0 (a manual-style restart does not bump it). So a naive pause is a ~30s
#   no-op and the operator is left believing a decoy is dark when it is not --
#   a false posture, which is worse than an honest outage. hp-autoheal is
#   therefore paused FIRST and resumed LAST, and pause refuses to run without
#   that gate in place.
#
#   PAUSE DOES NOT FREE RAM. The issue says "free RAM/CPU". Measured on
#   2026-09-27, cgroup v2 memory.current for hp-elasticpot was 36,339,712 B
#   running and 36,360,192 B while paused -- it went UP by 20 KiB. `docker
#   pause` freezes the cgroup (CPU stops being scheduled) but keeps the memory
#   charged to it. It is a CPU lever, not a RAM lever. For real RAM you must
#   `docker stop`, which is a different and more destructive operation and is
#   NOT what this script does. This is stated in the runbook too, because
#   discovering it after a leg OOMs is the expensive way to learn it.

# The classification. This table IS the substance of #3135.
#
# Verdict per stack:
#   SAFE  - may be paused. A decoy whose only effect of being paused is that
#           it stops answering on its own port. No dependent, no capture path,
#           no shared state, not a worker anything waits on.
#   UNIT  - pause-safe only as a whole stack, because the containers have a
#           real dependency on each other. Partial pausing hangs a live
#           session rather than ending it cleanly.
#   NEVER - not pause-safe, and the reason is given.
#
# Columns: verdict|stack|containers|probe|reason
# `probe` is the real request made to prove the decoy answers again after
# resume. tcp:PORT = a completed TCP connect. http:PORT/path = a real HTTP
# request whose status code must be 200.

read -r -d '' CLASSIFICATION <<'EOF' || true
SAFE|honeypot-elasticpot|hp-elasticpot|http:9201/|Standalone Elasticsearch decoy, no dependents, no shared state. Single container, no in-flight session to strand. Dry-run proven 2026-09-27.
SAFE|honeypot-multipot|hp-multipot|tcp:110|Multi-protocol decoy (pop3/imap/socks/dockerv2/tls/adb/redis/elastic). No dependents, no upstream. Each emulated service answers on connect.
SAFE|honeypot-dicompot|hp-dicompot|tcp:11112|Standalone DICOM decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-dnp3|hp-dnp3|tcp:20000|Standalone DNP3 decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-sentrypeer|hp-sentrypeer|tcp:5070|Standalone SIP decoy. No dependents, no shared state.
SAFE|honeypot-hellpot|hp-hellpot|tcp:8080|Standalone SMTP/HTTP/FTP decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-endlessh|hp-endlessh|tcp:19024|Standalone SSH tarpit. No dependents. Long-lived tarpit sessions are abandoned, which is the intended dark.
SAFE|honeypot-rdp-honeypot|hp-rdp-honeypot|tcp:3389|Standalone RDP decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-cisco-asa-honeypot|hp-cisco-asa-honeypot|tcp:8443|Standalone ASA decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-sonicwall-sma-honeypot|hp-sonicwall-sma-honeypot|tcp:8543|Standalone SMA decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-citrix-honeypot|hp-citrix-honeypot|tcp:443|Standalone Citrix decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-mailoney|hp-mailoney|tcp:25|Standalone SMTP decoy. No dependents.
SAFE|honeypot-beelzebub|hp-beelzebub|tcp:2200|Standalone adaptive SSH/HTTP/MCP decoy. No dependents. NOTE: hosts an MCP endpoint; pausing it is a deliberate dark, not a defect.
UNIT|honeypot-conpot|hp-conpot,hp-conpot-guardian,hp-conpot-s7-1500,hp-conpot-s7-1200,hp-conpot-iec104,hp-conpot-kamstrup|tcp:102|One Arcane stack of six OT decoys sharing an image and a project. Pause all six or none: hp-conpot is the shared modbus/s7 front and the others are peers on it, so a partial pause leaves listeners up with no engine behind them.
UNIT|honeypot-cowrie|hp-cowrie,hp-honeyfs-implant|tcp:19022|hp-honeyfs-implant is the FUSE server that serves cowrie its fake filesystem. Pausing the implant alone hangs every filesystem operation inside a live session. Pause cowrie first, implant second; resume implant first, cowrie second.
UNIT|honeypot-dionaea|hp-dionaea,hp-tftp-relay|tcp:21|Largest single decoy (369MiB, ~14% CPU) and the one most worth pausing. hp-tftp-relay is a stack-internal dependency, and dionaea holds an internal MySQL plus live sessions, so it goes as a unit: dionaea first, relay second. Never pause dionaea alone.
UNIT|honeypot-galah|hp-galah,hp-galah-llm-broker|tcp:8888|hp-galah proxies its LLM calls through hp-galah-llm-broker. Pausing the broker alone makes galah's own decoy paths fail in a way that looks like a broken decoy rather than a stand-down.
UNIT|honeypot-canarytokens|hp-canarytokens-http-router,hp-canarytokens-frontend,hp-canarytokens-adapter,hp-canarytokens-switchboard,hp-canarytokens-redis|tcp:19427|Internal dependency chain router->adapter->switchboard->redis. Partial pause leaves the switchboard blocked on a frozen redis. Pause front to back, resume back to front.
NEVER|honeypot-elk|hp-elasticsearch,hp-filebeat,hp-zeek-proxy,hp-arkime-capture,hp-arkime-viewer,hp-kibana,hp-evebox,hp-pcap-sync,hp-extracted-file-importer|-|The capture pipeline. Pausing arkime-capture, zeek-proxy or pcap-sync stops packet capture at the point of arrival, which is silent data loss, and pausing elasticsearch stalls every sensor's event write. Not a decoy; it is what makes the decoys worth running. Highest single allocation on the host (elasticsearch ~10.6GiB) and the least safe to interrupt.
NEVER|honeypot-dashboard|hp-dashboard-next,hp-dashboard-oidc-sessions,hp-apiary-worker,hp-apiary-worker-enrichment,hp-apiary-worker-importer,hp-apiary-worker-payload-inventory,hp-apiary-backend-mounted,hp-services-adapter|-|The operator surface and the ES write consumers. Pausing the workers buffers Elasticsearch bulk queues and the dashboard stops answering -- so you cannot observe the stand-down you are performing, which defeats the point of recording it.
NEVER|honeypot-dashboard-backend|hp-apiary-backend|-|Auth and API surface. A paused backend fails every dashboard and CLI call with a hang, not a clean error.
NEVER|honeypot-keycloak|hp-keycloak,hp-keycloak-postgres|-|Identity tier. Dashboard, arcane and the OIDC login tests all authenticate through it; pausing it breaks logins, not just decoys.
NEVER|honeypot-arcane|hp-arcane|-|GitOps control plane. This is the container that would RE-CREATE a paused decoy on its next sync, so pausing it is arguably necessary -- but it is also the thing that reconciles the fleet, and a control plane held frozen across a long leg cannot report or repair drift. Deliberately excluded: reconcile first, pause decoys, do not freeze the orchestrator.
NEVER|honeypot-utilities|hp-docker-socket-proxy,hp-disk-space-monitor,hp-docker-hygiene,hp-log-maintenance,hp-reporter|-|Host watchdogs. Pausing hp-disk-space-monitor and hp-docker-hygiene during exactly the memory-hungry leg they exist to catch removes the guard against the failure you are creating. hp-docker-socket-proxy is also the socket autoheal drives.
NEVER|honeypot-tanner|hp-tanner,hp-tanner-api,hp-tanner-web,hp-tanner-redis,hp-tanner-docker,hp-tanner-phpox,hp-snare|-|Event sink, not a decoy. cowrie and dionaea POST their events here; pausing it makes live sensors error on their own event path and hp-tanner-redis holds session state in flight. Analysis of collected events is exactly what a leg must not interrupt.
NEVER|honeypot-payload-analysis|hp-yara-scanner,hp-payload-dedupe|-|Downstream payload analysis fed from Elasticsearch. Not a decoy, no listener, but it is a pipeline stage; freezing it mid-file leaves partial state. Out of scope for "honeypot sensors/decoys".
NEVER|honeypot-init|hp-geoipupdate,hp-threat-cidrs-refresh|-|Periodic updaters. Pausing hp-geoipupdate mid-write can leave a truncated GeoIP database, which then fails every enrichment silently.
NEVER|ml-worker|hp-ml-worker|-|Named in the cold protocol's LIVE_WORKERS. The cold-run mechanism governs this container via STOP_WORKERS=1 + trap; pausing it here would create a second, unreconciled source of truth for whether it is running. Do not touch.
NEVER|auth-events-worker|hp-auth-events-worker|-|Consumes Keycloak auth-failure events. Pausing it drops the very signal that tier exists to capture.
NEVER|ghidra|ghidra-ollama-1,ghidra-revdeck-1,ghidra-statictools-1,ghidra-ghidra-1|-|HARD PROHIBITION. ghidra-ollama-1 is the GPU slot holder and is named explicitly in the issue: never pause it while a benchmark holds the GPU. ghidra-revdeck-1 is in the cold protocol's LIVE_WORKERS. These are also the containers a leg is running to make room FOR.
NEVER|unsloth|hp-unsloth-studio|-|The training leg itself. It is the reason for pausing, not a target of it.
NEVER|rex86-eval|rex86-eval|-|The eval leg itself. Same reasoning.
NEVER|technitium|technitium-dns|-|Real recursive DNS for 192.168.42.50, not a decoy. A frozen resolver takes the host's name resolution with it.
NEVER|pentagi|graphiti,neo4j,pentagi,pgvector,pentagi-ollama-embedding,pgexporter,scraper|-|Unrelated product stack, not part of the honeypot. Out of scope.
NEVER|ghosts|ghosts-ghosts-api-1,ghosts-ghosts-postgres-1|-|Belongs to the sandbox isolation stack that #3312 audits. Standing it down is a separate, declared act (scripts/sandbox-standdown.sh), not a decoy pause.
NEVER|dashkcnext-dashkcchaos|dashkcnext-pg-414734,dashkcnext-kc-414734,dashkcnext-redis-414734,dashkcchaos-pg-404812,dashkcchaos-kc-404812,dashkcchaos-redis-404812|-|OIDC chaos-test fixtures. These ARE an active test. "Depended on by an active test" is an explicit NOT pause-safe condition in the issue; pausing them breaks a run in progress.
