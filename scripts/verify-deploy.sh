# verify-deploy.sh -- #3315: prove mechanically that what is deployed is the
# code we think is deployed.
#
# The problem this closes, in the issue's own words: deploy verification was
# "manual inference -- compare `docker images` creation time with the merge
# time, or grep a string out of the shipped binary". docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md
# documents what that inference costs: apiary-backend:latest on the homeserver
# carried `Labels: null` and a creation time of 2026-09-08, every merge since
# was undeployed, and nothing surfaced it. "Green, healthy, running the old
# code" is indistinguishable from a good deploy by every signal the stack
# reports.
#
# Since #3315 there are three stamps, all from the same build arg (GIT_SHA):
#
#   backend-service  the revision is compiled into the binary by build.rs and
#                    answered by /healthz as {"revision": ...}
#   dashboard-next   the revision is baked into public/build.json, served at
#                    /build.json
#   both images      org.opencontainers.image.revision on the image config
#
# This script reads them and compares them against a git ref, so the question
# becomes "is the deployed revision the one I asked for?" instead of a reading
# of two timestamps. It also measures the lag -- commits behind, and the age of
# the deployed commit -- which is the number that says "this is fine, it is just
# three weeks old" or "this is not fine".
#
# Every comparison is a pure function over values already in hand (compare_
# revision, evaluate_lag) so the decisions can be tested without a live host,
# the same split scripts/arcane-verify-recreate.sh uses.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-deploy.sh [options] [<expected-sha>]
#
#   <expected-sha>       the revision that should be deployed. Defaults to
#                        origin/main in --repo-root.
#   --healthz-url URL    HTTP endpoint whose JSON body carries `revision`.
#   --healthz-exec CMD   command whose stdout is that same JSON. Needed for
#                        backend-service, whose /healthz is internal-only: the
#                        image publishes no port, so from the host it is only
#                        reachable with `docker exec`. Example:
#
#                          --healthz-exec 'docker exec hp-apiary-backend sh -c
#                            "curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:${LISTEN_ADDR##*:}/healthz"'
#
#                        (The `${LISTEN_ADDR##*:}` is the image's own HEALTHCHECK
#                        trick: the port is derived at check time, not
#                        hardcoded, because several stacks mount this image on
#                        a non-default LISTEN_ADDR.)
#   --image REF          also read REF's org.opencontainers.image.revision
#                        label, and compare it to the same expected revision.
#                        The image carrying one revision while the container
#                        running from it reports another is its own finding.
#   --repo-root DIR      clone to read origin/main from (default: cwd).
#   --behind-days N      report lag once the deployed commit is more than N
#                        days old (default 3; 0 disables the lag check).
#   --warn-only          print every finding, exit 0 anyway. For callers that
#                        report rather than gate (diagnostics.yml).
#   -h, --help           this header.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every stamp agrees with the expected revision, or --warn-only.
#   1  a stamp is missing, unstamped, disagrees, or is stale past --behind-days.
#   2  the check could not be run at all: bad usage, no origin/main to compare
#      against, or the healthz endpoint did not answer. Distinct from 1 on
#      purpose -- "we could not tell" must never be read as "it is fine".
#
# Environment overrides (also what scripts/tests stubs, mirroring the
# SYFT_BIN/TRIVY_BIN convention in generate-image-sbom.sh):
#   CURL_BIN, DOCKER_BIN, PYTHON_BIN, GIT_BIN
