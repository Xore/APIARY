"""Fail when a running backend-service does not enforce the auth tier its
OpenAPI contract claims (#3325).

The contract publishes a `security` block on every operation outside the
service-token tier, and openapi.rs's own test asserts the public set is
exactly /healthz and /metrics. That proves the *document* is internally
consistent -- it says nothing about whether the middleware agrees. This
asks the running service, over HTTP, with no token at all: every secured
operation must answer 401/403, and every public operation must not.

That second half is the reason this exists as a script and not as a
schemathesis check. `ignored_auth` skips any operation the contract
declares public, so marking a live /api/v1 route public makes the check
silently pass while the route keeps serving unauthenticated callers --
verified on this very service, where demoting /api/v1/events produced a
green run and one warning. A gate that can be switched off by editing the
document it is supposed to police is not a gate. Deriving the expected
answer from the document but never trusting it about *which* operations
are secured is the whole design: a leak shows up as a 200 here, and a
route wrongly demoted in the document trips openapi.rs's test instead.

Stdlib only, matching the other checkers in this directory.

Usage:
    python scripts/check-api-auth-tier.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8081
    python scripts/check-api-auth-tier.py --base-url ... \\
        --contract arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/backend-service/openapi.json

Exits non-zero on any mismatch, naming the operation and the status it
answered instead.
