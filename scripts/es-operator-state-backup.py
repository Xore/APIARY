"""Export (and restore) the dashboard's operator-authored Elasticsearch state.

The stack's Elasticsearch store (`es-data`) is deliberately outside every
backup: it is tens of gigabytes of captured telemetry that a rebuilt stack
does not need in order to come back up. But `es-data` also holds a handful
of small indices whose contents nothing in the pipeline can regenerate --
the ones written by a human through the dashboard, and by nobody else:

  * `dashboard-config-v1`               the admin configuration singleton
  * `dashboard-users-v1`                user projections + per-user preferences
  * `dashboard-alert-state-v1`          operator acks / cooldowns
  * `dashboard-canarytokens-v1`         deployed decoy token definitions
  * `dashboard-credentials-v1`          bait credentials provisioned into honeypots
  * `dashboard-ip-block-v1`             the manual IP block list
  * `dashboard-reports-definitions-v1`  report definitions
  * `dashboard-workbench-recipes-v1`    analysis recipes (immutable revisions)
  * `dashboard-ml-anomaly-ack-v1`       operator acks/notes on ML anomalies
  * `dashboard-problem-reports-v1`      operator-submitted problem reports

`docs/settings-operations.md` used to describe config and users as "covered
by whatever snapshot/backup policy this cluster's other Elasticsearch-owned
dashboard data already has". No such policy has ever existed: `GET _slm/policy`
returns `{}`, the only script that took an ES snapshot was removed, and per
`docs/BACKUP-ESSENTIALS.md` §History it never succeeded once. So these
indices were in no backup at all.

An SLM policy into the `honeypot-fs` repository would NOT fix that. That
repository is `state/elasticsearch-snapshots` on the same host as `es-data`
-- a snapshot there dies with the disk, and `analysis/backup-honeypot.sh`
excludes that path from its archive, so the snapshot would not be backed up
either. It would also reintroduce exactly the coupling
`docs/BACKUP-ESSENTIALS.md` §History blames for taking the config backup
down for a week. So this tool exports the documents instead, as NDJSON, into
the same archive the secrets already travel in -- three destinations, off the
host, encrypted.

What it does NOT do, by design:

* No snapshots, no ILM, no cluster-level state. The bulk telemetry indices
  (`honeypot-v2-*` and the derived `dashboard-*` set listed in `DERIVED`
  below) stay out: every one of them is a pure function of something else,
  so deleting the index is the correct response to losing it. `--list`
  prints the whole split from the same ledger the export walks, so the
  scope cannot drift from the documentation of it.
* No `settings` block in the exported mapping. `GET _mapping` answers with
  server-generated values (`index.uuid`, `index.creation_date`,
  `index.provided_name`, `index.version.created`) that a create-index
  request is not guaranteed to accept, while the part that actually matters
  for reading the documents back -- the field mappings -- is what a restore
  needs. Index templates and ILM policies are re-applied by
  `arcane/home/honeypot-init/analysis/elasticsearch-setup.sh` on a fresh
  cluster anyway, so carrying them would be carrying a copy of the repo.

Reaching Elasticsearch: it publishes no host port (reached by name over the
`honeynet` Docker network), so the default transport is a throwaway
`curlimages/curl` container, digest-pinned on the same policy form as the
fleet's compose images (#1955) for the same reason reset-logs.sh pins its
own (#2348). Set `ES_CURL_BIN` to use a local curl instead -- that is how
the unit tests drive this against a stub.

Usage:
  scripts/es-operator-state-backup.py --dest DIR     # export (what the backups call)
  scripts/es-operator-state-backup.py --list         # print the ledger and the exclusions
  scripts/es-operator-state-backup.py --restore DIR  # put the documents back
  scripts/es-operator-state-backup.py --restore DIR --into 'check-{index}'
                                                       # ...into scratch indices

Env:
  ES_URL               base URL                     (default http://elasticsearch:9200)
  ES_NETWORK           Docker network to join       (default honeynet)
  ES_CURL_BIN          command used to reach ES instead of the pinned
                       container (shlex-split; e.g. `curl`)
  ES_CURL_TIMEOUT      seconds per request          (default 120)
  ES_PAGE_SIZE         documents per scroll page    (default 500)
  ES_MAX_INDEX_BYTES   per-index cap; a page that
                       crosses it is dropped whole   (default 33554432)
