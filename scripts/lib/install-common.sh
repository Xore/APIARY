#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shared provisioning framework for scripts/install-homeserver.sh and
# scripts/install-vps.sh -- #1609 Phase 5.
#
# Both installers used to carry their own copy of this: status tracking,
# marker-based resumability, retry-with-backoff, and the end-of-run summary.
# install-vps.sh's header claimed the two were "identical ... deliberately not
# reimplemented differently". They were not: its with_retry used
# `if "$@"; then return 0; fi` followed by `rc=$?`, and an if/fi that takes
# neither branch exits 0, so rc read 0 for a FAILED command and the last
# attempt returned success. Every with_retry call in that script -- package
# installs, git clone, cert restore, compose up -- was structurally incapable
# of reporting failure. That is #787's defect, fixed on the homeserver side in
# August and never ported. #2963 fixed the copy and landed a parity test;
# this file removes the second copy so there is nothing left to drift.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Each installer sets its own identity before
# sourcing (see install_common_require below):
#
#   INSTALLER_NAME          used in the summary banner and messages
#   LOG_DIR / MARKER_DIR    per-installer, deliberately not shared
#   SUMMARY_WIDTH           step-id column width in the summary (optional)
#   INSTALLER_CONF_EXAMPLE  named in --help and in config errors
#
# An installer may define print_summary_extra() to append its own trailer to
# the summary (install-vps.sh prints the fresh WireGuard public key there).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this is safe to source, given how these scripts actually run
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The extraction was deferred once because install-homeserver.sh does not only
# run from the checkout: systemd under SELinux cannot exec it from /home or
# /root, so the live homeserver runs a copy at
# /usr/local/sbin/apiary-install-homeserver.sh. A bare
# `source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/install-common.sh"` breaks there -- and under
# `set -uo pipefail` (no -e) a failed source only warns, after which every
# framework call becomes "command not found" and the run limps on. That is a
# worse failure than the drift it fixes, which is why it wasn't landed blind.
#
# So the resolver in each installer searches, in order:
#   1. $APIARY_INSTALL_LIB          -- explicit override
#   2. <dir of the script>/lib/     -- running from a checkout
#   3. /usr/local/lib/apiary/       -- running from an installed copy
# and hard-exits with an actionable message if none are readable, instead of
# continuing into a half-defined shell. `--install-self` puts both the script
# and this library in place so the copy-out path cannot lose one of the two.
