# Install a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner on this host, dedicated to
# fast CI feedback on already-trusted code -- NOT the deployment runner
# (scripts referenced from docs/CI-CD.md's "Home deployment" section,
# labels self-hosted/linux/x64/honeypot-home, environment production-home).
# This is a second, separate runner registration with its own labels, own
# sudo-less system user, and docker-group access (#2565: containers, the
# frontend lockfile check and the Keycloak/OIDC suites route here). Its
# trust boundary is different from the deployment runner's, but NOT
# because it lacks host-level capability -- docker-group membership is
# effectively root-equivalent on this host (a member can
# `docker run -v /:/host ...` and read/write anything), and this runner's
# checkout at /opt/stacks/apiary is also plain world-readable, so it can
# read e.g. /opt/stacks/honeypot-dashboard/.env directly without even
# touching Docker. #2780 measured both and confirmed neither is a
# containment boundary. What actually keeps this runner's blast radius
# below the deployment runner's is WHICH CODE gets to run on it: the
# ci-target router (push/workflow_dispatch, plus same-repo pull_request
# only when repo variable CI_HOMESERVER_PRS=true -- see docs/CI-CD.md's
# "GitHub CI runner" section, "Docker-group membership is an accepted
# trade-off" subsection, for the full decision) keeps fork-PR (attacker-
# controlled) code off this runner entirely. If that gate is ever wrong,
# the practical blast radius here is not meaningfully smaller than the
# deployment runner's -- treat a compromise of either the same way.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo scripts/github-ci-runner/install-ci-runner.sh --repo Xore/APIARY [--token TOKEN]
#
# --token is a short-lived (1h) registration token. If omitted, this script
# tries to fetch one itself via `gh api` (needs `gh auth login` done for an
# account with admin on the repo) -- convenient for an operator re-running
# this after a token expires, but never required to be long-lived or
# stored anywhere.
#
# --instance N (#2572): registers a SECOND, THIRD, ... independent instance
# on the same box instead of re-touching the primary one. Before this flag
# existed, RUNNER_HOME/RUNNER_USER were fixed constants no matter what
# --name got passed, so a second `--name second-ci` invocation collided
# with the already-registered $RUNNER_HOME/.runner and either no-opped
# (leaving only one instance actually running) or clobbered it -- there was
# no way to actually scale past one executor. Every instance still
# registers under the SAME RUNNER_LABELS (honeypot-ci): GitHub schedules a
# queued job onto whichever instance is idle, so quality.yml's matrix rows
# (each already independent per #2389/#2565) gain real parallelism instead
# of serializing behind one machine. Default instance "1" reuses the
# original /opt/github-ci-runner + github-ci-runner user + "$HOSTNAME-ci"
# name unchanged, so the already-registered instance needs no migration.

# instances that is ~60 GB, and $RUNNER_HOME lives under /opt, which on this

#
# not with a disk-space message -- /tmp is on / too, and a linker that runs out
# of room mid-mmap gets SIGBUS. It reads as a compiler crash, which is a long
# way from "the disk is full".
#
# Only DATA is relocated. The runner's own executables stay in $RUNNER_HOME on
# /opt deliberately: files under /var are labelled var_t, and systemd's init_t
# cannot exec a var_t file -- the same SELinux rule that broke
# backup-honeypot.service. Moving the whole runner would trade a full disk for a
