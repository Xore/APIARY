# Install a Docker Hub pull-through cache on this CI executor (#2819).
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Docker Hub meters ANONYMOUS pulls per source IP, at roughly 100 per 6h.
# Every `Containers` matrix row leaves this box through one address, and
# the tree carries 74 non-`scratch` Hub `FROM` lines across 18 images, so
# one cold run spends most of the budget and the next run 429s -- which is
# exactly how #2819 presented, as arbitrary rows failing with
# `toomanyrequests` while their neighbours built fine.
#
# Authenticating (secrets DOCKERHUB_USERNAME / DOCKERHUB_TOKEN, wired into
# containers.yml) moves the meter from the shared IP to the account and is
# the necessary half of the fix. This script is the durable half: a
# `registry:3` proxy that collapses 18 rows x N bases into ONE upstream
# fetch and keeps serving them across runs. It cuts registry traffic to a
# rounding error instead of merely raising the ceiling we hit.
#
# What it does NOT do
# -------------------
# It does not touch /etc/docker/daemon.json. buildx's `docker-container`
# driver runs its own containerd and never reads the host daemon's
# `registry-mirrors`, so a mirror configured there is silently ignored by
# every build in this repo. The mirror reaches buildkit through the
# `buildkitd-config` that containers.yml composes from repo variable
# CI_REGISTRY_MIRROR. Setting up this service without ALSO setting that
# variable changes nothing.
#
# And since #3380 the variable is a claim the workflow VERIFIES rather than
# believes: containers.yml probes `$CI_REGISTRY_MIRROR/v2/` on the executor
# it is actually running on, and writes the mirror into the buildkit config
# only if that answers 200. So on a host that never ran this script the
# variable no longer buys a silently-dead mirror -- the run says so, in its
# annotations and its job summary, and builds without a cache. Which is
# exactly the state #3380 was filed from: the variable was set, no host had
# run this script, and every run pulled from Hub directly with nothing to
# say so. `gh variable set` is therefore only half the install; this script
# is the other half, and the two have to land on the same box.
#
# The address is a per-host fact that a repository variable can only
# approximately express. The `honeypot-ci` pool spans more than one box
# (the homeserver and `precision`, #3379), so one value is right on one and
# wrong on the other. Run this script on every executor that should have a
# mirror; the hosts that do not will report the disagreement themselves.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo scripts/github-ci-runner/install-registry-mirror.sh \
#       --username <hub-user> --token <hub-read-only-PAT>
#
#   # then, once, from a machine with `gh` admin on the repo:
#   gh variable set CI_REGISTRY_MIRROR --repo Xore/APIARY --body '172.16.0.1:5555'
#
# --token accepts a Docker Hub personal access token with "Public repo
# read-only" scope. It is the same account containers.yml authenticates
# as; the proxy needs it because an unauthenticated pull-through cache
# inherits the very anonymous limit we are escaping. It is written to a
# root-only env file, never to the container's `docker inspect` output.
