#
# Run from the stack root (same dir as docker-compose.yml/compose.yml).
# Requires: docker, sudo (log dirs are owned by container UIDs).
#
# Elasticsearch cleanup reaches elasticsearch:9200 via a throwaway
# container on the honeynet network (it has no host-published port), and
# deletes by log.file.path rather than by index-per-sensor pattern:
# honeypot-v2-* is one shared data stream for every sensor, not one index
# each, and the old per-target `DELETE /honeypot-<target>-*` calls matched
# zero real indices for anything but suricata -- confirmed live, this had
# silently deleted nothing for cowrie/conpot/multipot/http/dionaea/dnp3/
# tanner since the day those lines were written.
#
# #258: conpot, cowrie, multipot, http (http-honeypot+api-honeypot), and dnp3
# each now deploy as their own Dockge stack (/opt/stacks/honeypot-<name>/
# compose.yml), not inside APIARY's own compose.yml. A bare
# `docker compose stop/up` run from this directory resolves against *this*
# directory's compose.yml (Compose's default file-discovery prefers
# compose.yml over docker-compose.yml, which is why this already worked
# against the deployed stack rather than the repo-tracked filename) and
# would silently find nothing for those services' names now that they live
# in a different project. Their stop/up runs from each stack's own directory
# instead, matching how they were actually deployed, so Compose resolves the
# same project each was created under.
