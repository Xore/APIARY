# install-backup-essentials.sh — enable the daily essentials backup on the
# workstation that acts as the backup host.
#
# Modelled on sandbox/install-worker.sh and
# analysis/github/install-github-publisher.sh's unit-install shape: the script
# is copied out to /usr/local/libexec rather than run in place.
#
# analysis/install-backup-timer.sh deliberately does the opposite, because
# backup-honeypot.sh tars up the very checkout it lives in and a copied-out
# version would silently drift from what it backs up. backup-essentials.sh has
# no such coupling -- it only talks to remote hosts over SSH -- so copying it
# out costs nothing.
#
# It is also required here, not a preference. The backup host runs Rocky with
# SELinux enforcing, where a systemd unit cannot exec a file labelled
# user_home_t:
#
#   avc: denied { execute } ... scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0
#                                tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0
#
# Running in place from ~/Github/APIARY fails with 203/EXEC. Anything under
# /usr/local/libexec gets bin_t and just works.
#
# Re-run this script after a `git pull` to pick up a new version.
#
# Run once, as root, on the backup host:
#   sudo scripts/install-backup-essentials.sh
#
# Env:
#   RUN_AS                  user the timer runs as       (default: the invoking sudo user)
#   REPO_DIR                checkout to run from         (default: this script's repo)
#   CONFIRM_NEW_PASSPHRASE  1 = allow minting a new passphrase even though
#                           archives encrypted with an old one already exist
#                           on any backup destination     (default: refuse)
