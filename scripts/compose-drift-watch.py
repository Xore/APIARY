"""Alarm when a compose-defined, always-on service has no container at all
while its project siblings are actually running (#2747).

2026-08-31: a `systemctl restart docker` (#2743) surfaced four services
across three Dockge/Arcane stacks (`honeypot-elk`'s elasticsearch and
kibana, `honeypot-keycloak`'s postgres, `ghosts`'s ghosts-postgres) that had
**no container at all** -- not even a stopped one -- while their dependent
app containers kept running against a backing store that did not exist.
None of the four had a `docker events` destroy/die entry in the recent
history checked, so `restart: unless-stopped` never got a chance to save
them: a container that was never created has nothing to restart. Elasticsearch
sat in this state long enough that its absence was the standing condition,
not a blip -- with no alarm anywhere. This is a dedicated fleet-wide sweep
for exactly that shape, in the spirit of `disk-usage-watch.py` (#2743) and
the runner-capacity report (#2744), following `ci-queue-watch.py`'s (#2499)
proven de-dup design rather than inventing a new one.

What counts as drift:

- A service is "expected to persist" if its resolved `restart` policy is
  anything other than `no`/unset. This is a structural signal, not a
  hardcoded exclusion list: `honeypot-init`'s six one-shot setup jobs
  (arkime-init, elasticsearch-setup, honeypot-kibana-setup, log-init,
  persona-apply, snare-clone) all declare `restart: no` and are legitimately
  expected to reach zero containers once they've run -- they resolve out of
  the "expected to persist" set on their own, with no special-casing of the
  project name. A profile-gated service not in the compose file's active
  profile set does not appear in `docker compose config` output at all, so
  it is never considered either.
- "No container at all" means zero containers in any state (`docker compose
  ps -a`), not "not currently running" -- a stopped-but-existing container
  is a different, already-visible problem (`docker ps -a` shows it).
- The alarm only fires when at least one *other* service in the same
  project has a container in the `running` state. This is the "while
  dependants run" half of the issue title: it is what makes a missing
  sidecar dangerous (something is actively serving traffic against a
  backing store that silently isn't there) rather than "the whole stack was
  never started," which is a different, self-evident condition.

Design mirrors ci-queue-watch.py's proven shape:
- A single open `compose-drift-alarm`-labeled issue at a time: a sweep that
  finds continued drift appends to it; a sweep that finds it resolved closes
  it with the recovery evidence.
- Refuses to read a broken scan as a healthy fleet: zero project directories
  found, or `docker compose config`/`ps` failing on *every* project, is
  fatal rather than silently reported as "nothing wrong." A single project's
  `config`/`ps` failure (e.g. a missing required env var) is reported
  separately as "could not resolve" and does not block the rest of the
  sweep or get silently swallowed.
- Runs directly on the host being swept (no separate SSH credential or
  network path to the thing being measured), same reasoning
  disk-usage-watch.py and ci-queue-watch.py both give for their own designs.

Usage (the .github/workflows/compose-drift-watch.yml cron runs the first
form, on the homeserver-backed self-hosted runner):
  scripts/compose-drift-watch.py [--dry-run] [--stacks-root /var/dockge/stacks]
  --dry-run prints the would-be action and exits (no issue writes).

#2855: this sweep originally only checked a live stack directory against
*itself* (does a service that should persist have a container). It never
asked the reverse question -- does this live directory's project still
exist anywhere in the repo at all? A stack fully retired from the repo
(its whole `arcane/home/<name>/` directory deleted, as #2469 did for
wordpot) is invisible to the original check: its live directory under
`/var/dockge/stacks/` still has a stale `compose.yml` copy from before
retirement, so it resolves and gets checked for *internal* drift like any
other project, but nothing ever flagged "this project doesn't exist in the
repo any more and is still running" -- confirmed live: `hp-wordpot` ran
healthy for weeks after #2469 with zero alarms from this sweep (#2814).
Fixed by cross-checking each live stack directory's name against
`arcane/manifests/home-production.json`'s `syncName` list -- the same
canonical source of truth `scripts/install-homeserver.sh` and this repo's
own docs already treat as authoritative for "which 37 stacks exist"
(`docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md`), rather than re-deriving a second list by
grepping `arcane/home/*` (which would also miss the manifest's six
self-contained, non-`arcane/home/`-nested entries: `auth-events-worker`,
`llm-worker`, `ml-worker`, `ghidra`, `ghosts`, `pihole`).

# under two minutes -- nowhere near enough to answer "has this been going

# container name in a small state file, persisted across the 30-minute
# cron's scheduled runs, cleared the moment a container's streak returns to
