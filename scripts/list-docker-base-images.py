"""List every external base image a Dockerfile/Containerfile in this repo
pulls, for #2316's scheduled trivy scan (image-security-scan.yml).

Dependabot's docker updater only proposes an update when the *tag* in a
FROM line changes -- confirmed against this repo's own PR history (every
digest-pinned docker-ecosystem Dependabot PR examined paired a digest change
with a tag/version-string change; none was a same-tag digest-only refresh).
A base image that gets rebuilt under the same tag (a security patch to
`alpine:3.24`, say) is invisible to it forever. Trivy scanning the resolved
image directly closes that gap regardless of whether a newer tag exists, and
regardless of whether the directory is in dependabot.yml's `directories:` at
all -- this walks the whole tree itself, so it also closes the 22-directory
coverage gap #2316 found in dependabot's docker section as a side effect.

Multi-stage builds are handled: a `FROM <name>` that refers to an `AS <name>`
declared earlier in the *same file* is a build-stage reference, not an
external image, and is excluded.

The virtual `scratch` base (and any `FROM ${ARG}` still carrying an
unexpanded build-arg) is excluded too: neither resolves to a pullable image,
and trivy FATALs the whole scan when handed one.

Usage: python3 scripts/list-docker-base-images.py
Prints one deduplicated image reference per line, sorted.
