"""Behaviour tests for scripts/honeypot-pause.sh (#3135).

The classification table in that script is the substance of the issue: a wrong
"safe" does not fail loudly, it silently breaks a decoy that was carrying the
honeypot surface. So what is worth pinning is the table's *shape* and the
refusals, not today's container names -- Arcane can and does add stacks, and
these tests should fail when someone adds one without classifying it, not when
a decoy is legitimately renamed.

The cases below are each a way this could quietly go wrong:

- a stack added to the host but never classified, so `pause` neither accepts
  it nor explains why -- the operator is left guessing, and guessing is how a
  GPU container gets paused;
- the GPU/training stacks drifting out of NEVER, which is the one prohibition
  #3135 names in so many words;
- a container in the runbook table that the script does not actually gate on,
  so the runbook and the enforcement drift apart in the direction that
  matters;
- the cold-run interlock losing a pattern, so a pause could land on top of
  STOP_WORKERS=1 + the restore trap it is explicitly not allowed to touch;
- the autoheal gate going missing, which does not fail -- it silently
  restores every decoy about 30s after it is paused (measured 2026-09-27);
- default-deny turning into default-allow, so an unclassified name reaches
  `docker pause` instead of being refused by name.
