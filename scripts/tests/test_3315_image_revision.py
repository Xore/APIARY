"""Exercise the #3315 revision stamp end to end, without a live host.

Three things this covers, and why each needs its own harness:

* `frontend-next/scripts/write-build-info.mjs` -- run for real with node, over
  the corpus of values a `--build-arg GIT_SHA` could plausibly carry. The
  point is not that it writes JSON (any shell printf does that) but what it
  does with a value that is not an object name, and that it agrees with
  backend-service's own normalizer, which is a different language in a
  different CI lane and can only be kept in step by a shared corpus.

* The Dockerfile/compose wiring -- asserted as text. Neither cargo nor vitest
  can see that `ARG GIT_SHA` is declared in *both* stages of a multi-stage
  build, that the label lands on the runtime image rather than the discarded
  build stage, or that the file the build writes is written before the build
  that has to copy it. Those are the three ways this feature can exist in the
  repository and not exist in any image, and all three are silent.

* `scripts/verify-deploy.sh` -- driven against a real throwaway git repo with
  stub `curl`/`docker` binaries, because the script's whole value is the
  verdict it returns, and a verdict is not worth much if the only thing anyone
  ever checks is that the file parses.
