# test-keycloak-realm-import.sh — boots an ephemeral, disposable
# Keycloak + PostgreSQL and imports keycloak/realm/apiary-realm.json through
# the exact bootstrap path arcane/home/honeypot-keycloak/compose.yml uses on every real
# fresh install (`kc.sh start --import-realm`), then asserts it actually
# succeeds.
#
# #982 phase 1 / #1040: keycloak/realm/validate.sh's jq checks are static --
# they check structure and policy, never what a real Keycloak+Postgres
# import does with the file. That gap let a 263-char role description (over
# Postgres's KEYCLOAK_ROLE.DESCRIPTION varchar(255) column) crash-loop the
# container on any genuinely fresh install, undetected until this script's
# manual precursor caught it live. This is the regression test for that
# class of bug -- it does not exercise login, roles, or client behavior
# (that's the rest of #982), only "does the realm this repo ships actually
# import into a real Keycloak."
#
# Uses no arcane/home/honeypot-keycloak/compose.yml secrets/volumes -- this is a
# throwaway topology (plain `docker run`, ephemeral network, ephemeral
# ports, ephemeral admin credentials), never real production Keycloak.

# #2915: the `trap ... EXIT` below does not fire on SIGKILL (a runner OOM-kill,
# a cancelled CI job escalating past SIGTERM, a hard timeout). A killed run
# leaves its containers -- still *running*, so `--rm` would never fire --
# together with their anonymous volumes and their network, for the life of the
# runner. That accumulation is the harm #2915 reports; it is not a port
# collision, since every port this script binds is picked ephemerally by
# `bind(("127.0.0.1", 0))`.
#
# So reap survivors of an earlier killed run before creating this run's own,
# skipping anything younger than ${reap_min_age_s}. The fleet runs several
# self-hosted runners against one Docker daemon and the names below carry `$$`
# precisely so runs may overlap -- an unguarded sweep would delete a concurrent
# run's containers out from under it. The threshold is deliberately far longer
# than any full run of this script takes.
