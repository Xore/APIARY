# install-trivy.sh -- put one pinned, checksum-verified `trivy` in front of
# the calling job. #3321.
#
# Two workflows need trivy and they must answer the same question the same
# way:
#
#   * image-security-scan.yml scans every base image the tree's Dockerfiles and
#     compose files pull;
#   * containers.yml scans the digest-bound SBOM generated for the two
#     dashboard images (backend-service, dashboard-next).
#
# Those are the same CVE question asked of two different artefacts, and
# "are we affected?" is only answerable if the two agree. A version + asset +
# sha256 triple copied into two YAML files is precisely how they stop
# agreeing -- one gets bumped, the other does not, and the same advisory gets
# graded two ways with no visible cause. One installer, one pin.
#
# Pinned version + checksum instead of the upstream contrib/install.sh
# curl-|-sh pattern (SAST-flagged, #3115): download the release tarball
# directly and verify it against a hardcoded sha256 before extracting
# anything. The checksum is the archive's own, taken once at authoring time
# and carried here rather than fetched from a sidecar next to the download --
# a sidecar fetched over the same TLS session as the artefact detects
# transport corruption, which TLS already covers, not a compromised upstream.
#
# Installed into a runner-writable dir rather than /usr/local/bin: the
# self-hosted honeypot-ci runner has no write access to /usr/local/bin
# (install: Permission denied), and $RUNNER_TEMP is writable on both runner
# types.
#
# Usage:
#   install-trivy.sh             install, then prepend the dir to $GITHUB_PATH
#   install-trivy.sh --print-path  install, then print the binary path
#
# Overrides (all three must move together; see the guard below):
#   TRIVY_VERSION  release tag, e.g. 0.74.0
#   TRIVY_SHA256   sha256 of the release tarball for that version
#   TRIVY_BIN_DIR  where to unpack (default $RUNNER_TEMP/trivy-bin)
#   TRIVY_BIN      use this trivy verbatim and skip the fetch (trusted as
#                  given; no version check is applied to it)
set -euo pipefail

# The pin. Bump these together, after checking the release's own checksum
# file: TRIVY_SHA256 is the sha256 of the asset named below.
