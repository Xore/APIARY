"""Fail when automation references a label the catalogue cannot honour (#3216).

The 2026-09-17 label/census audit found the catalogue had grown to 30 labels
with nothing checking that the ones automation touches actually work, and the
residue it could not settle unilaterally was exactly that gap: Dependabot's
config named three labels -- `github-actions`, `go`, `containers` -- that did
not exist, so every Dependabot PR silently dropped them. Nothing failed. The
taxonomy drifted for ten days between the audit naming it and an operator
creating them.

GitHub applies a label that exists and drops one that does not, so a
nonexistent label is invisible: the PR opens, the grouping works, the triage
filter never matches. That is why this is a check and not a review step.

Two kinds of automation touch labels, and only one of them needs the label to
pre-exist:

1. **applies** -- `.github/dependabot.yml` lists labels for Dependabot to put
   on the PRs it opens. The label must exist before the PR does, or it is
   dropped without a word. This is where the 2026-09-17 finding lived.
2. **creates** -- the alarm watchers (`scripts/*-watch.py`, `main-health-watch`)
   each own one label and run `gh label create` for it on demand, so absence
   self-heals on the next sweep. The audit reached the same conclusion for
   these: zero open usage does not make a watcher-created label obsolete.

The ledger below is the decision the audit left open, now recorded next to
the thing that depends on it -- every automation-referenced label, and which
of the two kinds it is. Offline it cross-checks that ledger against the
sources; with `--live` it also asks GitHub whether each label is really there
and really has a description.

The 24 human-applied topic labels (`enhancement`, `bug`, `ops`, ...) are
deliberately out of scope: nothing in the repo references them by name, so
there is no drift for this guard to catch, and claiming otherwise would make
it a style opinion.

Usage:
    python scripts/check-label-taxonomy.py          # offline, CI-safe
    python scripts/check-label-taxonomy.py --live   # also query GitHub
