"""Report sensors whose events reach Elasticsearch without a category.

#789 originally diffed every event-kind string a homegrown Go sensor could
emit against `dashboard/classify.go`'s per-sensor switch, to find kinds the
dashboard had no explicit case for. #1659 deleted that file along with the Go
dashboard, and #1665 asked whether the concern still applies.

It does — but nothing like a classifier exists any more, so the old method
cannot be ported. Sensors now write structured JSON straight through the
`geoip-honeypot` ingest pipeline, and that pipeline does not classify: it
copies `honeypot.category` through to `event.category` when the sensor
supplied one, and does nothing when it did not. There is no per-sensor case
table left to have a gap against.

So the question moves from "does the classifier handle this kind" to "does
this sensor label its events at all", and that can only be answered from the
data. `honeypot.category` is the field that matters: backend-service's
events.rs reads it (falling back to suricata's alert category) and
frontend-next renders and filters on it. `event.category` is set by the
pipeline but no consumer reads it, so it is reported separately and only as
context.

This is an operational audit, not a CI check. The old one could run offline
because it read Go source; this one needs a populated Elasticsearch, which CI
does not have. `.github/workflows/quality.yml`'s step was removed rather than
left disabled, with that reasoning recorded in #1665.

Usage, on the homeserver where Elasticsearch is reachable:

    scripts/audit-sensor-event-coverage.py
    scripts/audit-sensor-event-coverage.py --since 7d --min-events 100
    scripts/audit-sensor-event-coverage.py --fail-under 50
