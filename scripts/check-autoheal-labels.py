"""Fail CI when a service has a healthcheck (compose-level OR baked into its
image's Dockerfile) but no `autoheal=true` label and no documented opt-out.

#119 asked for this guard when it first fixed the healthcheck/autoheal
pairing across the fleet; the gap came back anyway (#2051: keycloak,
postgres, galah-llm-broker, oidc-sessions), and a first sweep for the guard
missed a second blind spot on top of that (#2051's own follow-up comment):
services whose healthcheck is an image-level Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK`
instruction are invisible to a plain `grep healthcheck: compose.yml` sweep.
This scans both layers, which is the whole point -- a compose-only matcher
reproduces the exact blind spot that let http-honeypot/api-honeypot/
multipot/dicompot hide.

A service opts out of the label by carrying a comment containing the word
"autoheal" anywhere in its own block in the compose file -- e.g. explaining
why a wedge there should not trigger a restart. That comment is the
documentation the issue asked for; this script does not judge its content,
only that one exists.

Scope: every `compose.yml`/`docker-compose.yml` this repo actually deploys
from -- `arcane/home/*/compose.yml` plus the handful of root-level and
sandbox operational composes, and now `vps/docker-compose.yml` too (#2762:
the VPS runs its own docker-socket-proxy + autoheal pair as of that issue,
the same narrow-proxy shape as honeypot-utilities' instance on the
homeserver, so the pairing gap this guard exists to catch now applies there
the same way). Excluded: anything under a vendored tree (upstream-verbatim
per VENDORED.md, not this repo's own service definition) and the honeyfs
decoy filesystem prop under honeypot-cowrie (a fake file served *to*
attackers, not a real compose stack).
