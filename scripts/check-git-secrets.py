"""Fail CI when a real credential appears anywhere in FULL git history (#3501).

gitleaks does the detection; this script owns the policy, and the policy is
the whole point -- so it lives in Python where it is unit-testable rather
than in a workflow's `run:` block where it is not. The workflow installs the
pinned binary and calls this.

Scope is full history, not the checked-out tree: a credential that was
committed once and deleted in the next commit is still a credential, and
`gitleaks dir` cannot see it. That is the failure this gate exists to catch
and the reason it is its own lane rather than a row folded into the
public-leak check (which only ever walks `git ls-files`).

Shape, deliberately identical to `ALLOWED_DOTENV` /
`ALLOWED_LITERAL_FIXTURE_FILES` in scripts/check-public-leaks.py: an explicit,
commented, fail-closed set of paths, each carrying a written reason, and
each verified to exist. Renaming or deleting an allowlisted file re-surfaces
the failure on the next run rather than silently widening the exemption.

Usage:
  check-git-secrets.py                 # scan full history through the gitleaks on PATH
  check-git-secrets.py --binary PATH   # use this gitleaks instead of resolving one
  check-git-secrets.py --json FILE     # write gitleaks' own JSON report here
  check-git-secrets.py --allow-missing # skip the allowlist fail-closed check (tests only)

# Paths whose gitleaks findings are known false positives.
#
# Two shapes, and the distinction matters:
#
#   1. Honeyfs bait. `arcane/home/honeypot-cowrie/cowrie/honeyfs/**` is
#      cowrie's FAKE filesystem, served to a connecting attacker as
#      `wget`/`ftp`/shell targets. Its decoy `.env`, `/etc/shadow` hashes and
#      `authorized_keys` are the honeypot's product, not credentials --
#      scripts/check-public-leaks.py already names the `.env` in
#      ALLOWED_DOTENV for exactly this reason (#1502). Listed as a prefix
#      because the whole subtree is bait by construction; a new file there is
#      bait too, and adding it must not require a new entry.
#
#   2. Test fixtures and test-shaped strings. gitleaks' `generic-api-key`
#      rule is entropy- and keyword-driven, so it fires on the canary tokens
#      the honeypot's own tests assert on, on pinned Go/JS module hashes,
#      and on prose that happens to contain `api key` followed by a
#      high-entropy word. Each entry below names what the string actually is.
#      No entry is a wildcard and none covers a production credential.
#
# Fail-closed by construction: an entry naming a path that does not exist at
# scan time is a FAILURE (see `_verify_allowlist`), because a stale entry is
# an exemption for a file nobody is reading any more -- and the next real
# secret committed under that name sails through.

    years ago is simply not in the fetched commits, and reporting that as a
    miss would fail a healthy allowlist on every CI run (the #3516 failure).
