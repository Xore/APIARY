# arcane-deploy-honeypot-init.sh -- #2714: `honeypot-init` is six one-shot
# bootstrap containers by construction (persona-apply, log-init,
# elasticsearch-setup, honeypot-kibana-setup, arkime-init, snare-clone). Every
# deploy through Arcane's redeploy endpoint ends
# `{"error":"failed to deploy project: container <name> exited (0)"}` even
# when every job did exactly what it was supposed to and exited clean.
#
# Traced to the actual library Arcane's ComposeUp/Start call into
# (github.com/docker/compose/v5 pkg/compose, the same code `docker compose up
# --wait` itself runs): `--wait` builds a synthetic "must be running or
# healthy" condition for every project service UNLESS some other service in
# the same compose file depends on it via `condition:
# service_completed_successfully` (pkg/compose/start.go's
# getDependencyCondition). A service nothing depends on that way -- exactly
# what a *terminal* one-shot job is, by definition -- hits
# pkg/compose/convergence.go's isServiceHealthy(), which treats ANY exited
# container (regardless of exit code) as the literal error this issue is
# about. This is not an Arcane bug to patch around at the compose-file level:
# of the six jobs here, log-init and elasticsearch-setup already have a
# same-file dependent (honeypot-kibana-setup depends_on
# elasticsearch-setup; log-init depends_on persona-apply) and correctly never
# trip this. honeypot-kibana-setup, arkime-init, and snare-clone are genuine
# DAG leaves -- nothing in this file runs after them -- so there is no
# same-file service that can legitimately depend on them without inventing an
# artificial ordering coupling that doesn't reflect reality (and would just
# relocate the problem: whatever new sentinel service absorbed that
# dependency would itself become an unwired leaf). Confirmed against
# docker/compose v5.5.0 source, not guessed; matches an open, unimplemented
# upstream feature request (getarcaneapp/arcane#3305, "Treat successful
# one-shot Compose services as completed").
#
# So per this issue's own item 2: treat the specific shape
# `container <name> exited (0)` as success in OUR tooling, but only after
# verifying against real container state that every one-shot job actually
# completed clean -- never by pattern-matching the error string alone, which
# would just as happily swallow a genuine crash. Any other error is a real
# failure and is never suppressed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/arcane-deploy-honeypot-init.sh [--apply]
#   Without --apply, only looks up the project and prints what a deploy
#   would do (no redeploy call, no docker calls).
#
# Environment:
#   ARCANE_URL       Arcane API base URL (default: http://10.8.0.2:3552)
#   ARCANE_API_KEY   Arcane API key -- sent as `X-API-Key`, not
#                    `Authorization: Bearer` (this is the API-key credential
#                    type, distinct from the Bearer/session token
#                    scripts/arcane-retry-failed-sync.sh and
#                    scripts/install-homeserver.sh's arcane_api() use).
#   STACKS_ROOT      Where compose-managed stacks live, for the post-deploy
#                    verification pass (default: /var/dockge/stacks). Must be
#                    run somewhere docker can see these containers directly --
#                    i.e. on the homeserver itself.

# verify_one_shots_completed -- the actual safety check. Queries docker

# PASS/FAIL line per service and returns non-zero if ANY service is not
# cleanly Exited(0) -- missing entirely, still running, or a non-zero exit
# code are all treated as a real failure, never suppressed.
#
# Arcane's HTTP call returns the false-failure the instant the FIRST
# one-shot's exit trips waitDependencies' errgroup (see the header comment)
# -- it does not wait for the *other* one-shots to finish, because Arcane's
# own process has already stopped watching by then. The underlying docker
# containers keep running to completion regardless (Arcane's error is a
# reporting failure, not something that touches the containers). Live-tested
# 2026-09-01: three of six jobs were still `running` the instant this
# function first ran, and all six were cleanly `exited 0` within 30 seconds.
# So this polls for every service to reach a terminal (non-running,
# non-created) state before judging pass/fail, instead of a single snapshot.
