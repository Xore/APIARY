"""Report how far each Arcane gitops-sync record has drifted from `main`
(#2858). `autoSync` is `false` on every one of the 37 registered syncs — a
deliberate decision (see docs/ARCANE-GIT-SYNC.md, "autoSync decision
(#2858)"), not an oversight -- but a manual-only model has no visibility of
its own: nothing previously reported how far behind a project had fallen
until someone noticed a missing feature weeks later (#2815/#2816/#2817, three
separate "a merged PR never reached the host" issues that turned out to share
this one cause).

This is read-only and on-demand -- it does not sync or redeploy anything, and
it is not wired into a scheduled workflow (that would need an Arcane
credential available to CI, which is a separate, not-yet-made decision; see
the doc section above). Run it by hand, or from a personal cron/timer that
already has the credential, whenever a drift check is wanted.

Usage:
  ARCANE_API_KEY=... scripts/arcane-sync-drift-report.py [--behind-days N] [--repo-root PATH]

Exits non-zero if any project is more than --behind-days (default 3) days
past its last successful sync, if a sync's own lastSyncStatus is "failed"
and the project is not in KNOWN_STRUCTURAL_FAILURES below, or if a record's
lastSyncAt is absent, null or unparseable. That last case is a failure and not
a printed `?`: a record with no readable lastSyncAt is precisely the shape a
never-synced project has (#2853), which is the condition this report exists to
surface -- passing it silently would let the worst case be the quietest one.

The `failed` exemption is what makes the exit code carry information:
`honeypot-init` reports `failed` on every deploy for a structural reason Arcane
never rewrites (#2854), so without it this script would exit non-zero on a
healthy fleet, every run, forever -- the same
permanently-red-and-therefore-ignored shape scripts/isolation-audit.sh's
tiering comment was written against.

What a clean run does and does not mean
---------------------------------------
`lastSyncStatus` is unreliable in *both* directions, so exit 0 means "no record
reports a failure, a stale timestamp or an unreadable one" -- it does **not**
mean the fleet is deployed:

  #2854  `failed` when the deploy in fact succeeded (a `restart: no` one-shot's
         clean exit(0) read as an abort). Handled here by the exemption above.
  #2910  `success` when nothing was recreated -- Arcane's 5-minute sync deadline
         elapses, the retry reports success, and the container is untouched.
         Nothing in this API response distinguishes that from a real deploy;
         only comparing container creation time against lastSyncAt can, which
         needs host access this script deliberately does not take.
  #2853  a project that has never synced at all, whose lastSyncAt is null.
         Failed rather than printed as `?`, per the paragraph above.

Judge a project by its containers before concluding it is deployed.
