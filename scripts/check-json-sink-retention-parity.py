"""Fail CI when a JSON-emitting /logs directory lacks either retention half.

The #120 contract is two-sided: each JSON-emitting sensor self-rotates its
sink into generations with a digit-leading suffix, and
honeypot-utilities' log-maintenance.sh prunes those generations once they
age past the shared window. #2196 shipped because mailoney broke BOTH
halves at once -- its sink appended forever AND no pruner glob existed --
and nothing structural would have caught either omission; only a person
reading compose volumes next to pruner code next to vendored sensors
could connect them. This script is that connection, checked mechanically
on every push.

The ROWS ledger below is deliberately hand-written rather than inferred:
it documents WHERE each half lives for every rotating sink we know about,
so adding a sensor means adding one reviewable row, and forgetting either
half fails here naming exactly which half is missing. Two sides per row:

- "writer": where the rotation implementation itself lives, proven by a
  grep token in that subtree (a knob name or rotate() definition);
- "glob": the exact pruner find-line fragment log-maintenance.sh must
  carry for that directory.

The reverse check keeps the ledger honest too: every `find /logs/<dir>`
line in the pruner must be claimed by some row, so pruning coverage
cannot silently grow an unledgered entry (or lose one).

#2216 review: the two checks above only see the halves an author already
remembered to touch. A brand-new stack that bind-mounts a log directory,
appends a `.json` sink into it forever, adds no pruner line and no ROW
passed all of them, which is exactly the drift acceptance criterion 4 of
that issue asks this script to fail on. So there is a third check, and it
starts from the one artifact a new stack cannot omit and still reach disk:
its compose bind mount. Every `/opt/stacks/apiary/logs/<dir>` mount under
arcane/home/*/compose.yml must be accounted for by name -- as a ROWS
directory, an EXEMPT entry with a written reason, or a KNOWN_UNCOVERED
entry naming the issue that tracks it. Anything else fails.

Two supporting rules keep that enumeration from rotting:

- a `-name` glob is credited only to the `find` line for its OWN
  directory, so moving one onto a neighbouring line (leaving a directory
  unpruned while every glob string still appears somewhere in the file)
  fails instead of passing;
- a ROWS/EXEMPT/KNOWN_UNCOVERED entry for a directory nothing mounts any
  more is reported as stale, so a retired stack takes its ledger entry
  with it.
