"""Shared GPU job queue -- ES-backed, stdlib-only.

Any worker that needs the shared GPU (ghidra-worker.py's AI triage today;
llm-worker's session/payload/report analysis is the natural next consumer)
checks headroom before calling Ollama. If there isn't enough, it enqueues a
job here instead of blocking or failing, and a small drainer picks queued
jobs back up once headroom frees. The dashboard reads/aborts queued jobs
through this same index -- no direct file access, matching the rest of the
dashboard's ES-only read path.

Deliberately stdlib-only (urllib + subprocess, no `elasticsearch` client, no
third-party deps) so this one file can be vendored as-is into any worker's
environment without adding a dependency -- ghidra-worker.py runs host-side
with nothing but the interpreter, and this needs to work there unchanged.
It is *vendored*, not imported across containers: see
analysis/ghidra/worker/gpu_queue.py (installed alongside ghidra-worker.py by
install-analysis-host.sh) and llm-worker/gpu_queue.py (copied in at build
time). Keep those in sync with this canonical copy -- a contract test in
each consumer's test suite asserts byte-for-byte equality, the same pattern
already used for TRIAGE_SYSTEM/TRIAGE_WORKFLOWS between ghidra-worker.py and
evaluate-models.py (see analysis/ghidra/worker/tests/test_ghidra_worker.py).

Every function here is a plain HTTP call to Elasticsearch or `nvidia-smi`;
none of it executes captured data or picks a model -- that decision stays
with the caller.

# Elasticsearch has no port published to the host on purpose (every other

# container, and can't resolve `elasticsearch` directly. Detect that case

# abort_requested is honoured in two places (#1698). gpu-queue-drain.py checks
# it once before it starts, and ghidra-worker.py checks it again between
# streamed chunks while the model is generating -- abandoning that stream is
# what frees the GPU, because ollama cancels the inference task when the
# client disconnects (verified against 0.32.13: `srv stop: cancel task`).
#
# Setting the flag on a job that has already finished is still a harmless
# no-op, which is why nothing here refuses based on status.
