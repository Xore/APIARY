# #264: T-Pot treats Kibana dashboards as versioned, recoverable artifacts
# (docker/tpotinit/dist/bin/backup_kibana_config.sh, a checked-in
# kibana_export.ndjson, explicit README export/import instructions). This
# repo's ELK setup (elasticsearch-setup.sh) never touched Kibana saved
# objects -- any dashboard an operator built lived only in Elasticsearch's
# .kibana index, with no recovery path on an ES reset/migration/upgrade.
#
# Usage: analysis/kibana-export.sh [output-file]
# Reachable over honeynet by default -- run from a container/host that can
# resolve "kibana", or set KIBANA_URL to an externally reachable address
# (e.g. http://<HP_BIND>:19601).
