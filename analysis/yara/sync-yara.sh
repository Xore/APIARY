# sync-yara.sh — vendor the upstream YARA corpus into this scanner.
#
# Fetches yara-rules/*.yar and yara-rules/auto/*.yar from Xore/Honeypot,
# compiles them before adopting them, and pins the upstream commit in
# rules/upstream.lock. Mirrors scripts/sync-theme.sh: vendor, pin, and let CI
# enforce that the tree still matches the pin.
#
# WHY VENDOR INSTEAD OF PULLING ON A TIMER
#
# The scanner sidecar runs network_mode: none, read_only: true, with rules
# baked in at image build (analysis/yara/Dockerfile COPYs this directory). It
# cannot fetch anything, and giving a container that reads live malware a
# network so it can download rule files is a much worse trade than syncing at
# the repository level. So the sync happens here, in a checkout, by an operator
# or a scheduled job — and the corpus that reaches the scanner is the one
# recorded in the lock file.
#
# WHY COMPILATION IS THE GATE
#
# yara(1) loads a rule set or refuses to start. A corpus with one broken rule
# does not degrade to "everything except that rule" — it disables scanning
# entirely, and the scanner's own startup probe is the only thing that would
# ever notice. Validating here means a bad upstream commit is a failed sync
# with a message, instead of a sidecar that has quietly stopped detecting.
#
# Note: the plan text says `yara --compile`, which is not a real flag. yarac(1)
# is the compiler; `yara <rules> <file>` compiles and then scans. Either proves
# the corpus compiles, and both are accepted below.
#
