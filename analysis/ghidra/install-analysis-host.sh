#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-analysis-host.sh — stand up the Ghidra analysis backend on this host.
#
# Brings up three containers and wires the host-side worker to them:
#
#   ghidra       built from ./service in this directory -- official Ghidra
#                releases fetched checksum-verified at build time behind a
#                small REST wrapper, the decompiler behind /analyze (the
#                third-party packaging this replaced came off the stack
#                in #245; see docker-compose.ghidra.yml)
#   ollama       the local model that produces ai_triage (#103)
#   statictools  ssdeep/tlsh fuzzy hashing and lief structural parsing (#138)
#
# All three publish on 127.0.0.1 only. Between them they hold captured malware
# and every string, fuzzy hash and structural fact extracted from it, and the
# triage prompts are that text — so the model has to be on this host, and the
# worker refuses to talk to one that is not (see endpoint_is_local in
# worker/ghidra-worker.py).
#
# On a host running Dockge the compose file is deployed into a stack directory
# under /opt/stacks, the same place deploy.yml puts the honeypot stack, so the
# containers show up as a stack Dockge manages rather than as strays it can see
# but not touch. That directory is a deployment copy: edit the file in this
# repository and re-run this script, do not edit it there.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after a pull, a model change, or a reboot. An
# existing /etc/default/honeypot-ghidra is never overwritten.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo analysis/ghidra/install-analysis-host.sh          # containers + worker
#   analysis/ghidra/install-analysis-host.sh --containers-only
#
# Options:
#   --containers-only  Bring up/refresh the containers and stop. Needs docker
#                      but not root, which is the half an operator in the
#                      docker group can run.
#   --host-files-only  The inverse of --containers-only: skip the Ghidra/
#                      Ollama/statictools containers entirely and only
#                      re-install the worker/systemd-unit half. Needs root.
#                      For CI to re-sync ghidra-worker.py and siblings on a
#                      routine deploy without also restarting the GPU
#                      containers every time (#1406).
#   --model NAME       Model to pull (default qwen3:14b, or GHIDRA_TRIAGE_MODEL
#                      from /etc/default/honeypot-ghidra if that file exists).
#   --no-gpu           Run the model on CPU even if an NVIDIA runtime is present.
#   --skip-pull        Do not pull the model. For a host that already has it.
#   --stack-dir PATH   Where to deploy the compose file. Defaults to
#                      /opt/stacks/ghidra when /opt/stacks exists, else the
#                      repository directory. Pass "" to run in place.
