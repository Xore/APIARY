# Local model benchmark

This directory contains the task-specific acceptance benchmark used by
[issue #144](https://github.com/Xore/honeypot-stack/issues/144) and governed by
[issue #158](https://github.com/Xore/honeypot-stack/issues/158). The decision
record, literature review, measurements, and recommendations live in
[`docs/local-llm-model-evaluation.md`](../../../docs/local-llm-model-evaluation.md).

## Safety properties

- Fixtures are synthetic and use only TEST-NET addresses, reserved
  `.test`/`.invalid` names, and fake credentials.
- Input is sent only to the configured Ollama URL, which defaults to loopback.
- The script never executes fixture content or manages a process, container,
  VM, network rule, or model download.
- GPU telemetry is read with `nvidia-smi`; its absence is reported as `null`.
- Each candidate is explicitly unloaded before the next one.

Review every new fixture for routable addresses, real secrets, and executable
side effects before committing it.

## Run

Install candidate tags as a separate reviewed operator action, then run the
three approved/candidate slots on the analysis host. The benchmark never pulls
them itself:

```bash
install -d -m 0700 "$HOME/model-qualification"
python3 evaluate-models.py \
  --manifest ../models/approved-models.json \
  --output "$HOME/model-qualification/qualification.json"
python3 ../models/model-governance.py verify-report \
  --manifest ../models/approved-models.json \
  --report "$HOME/model-qualification/qualification.json"
```

Only short progress and the report hash are printed. Preserve the raw report
outside the repository with bounded retention; put the scored measurements and
reproducibility metadata in the decision record. Do not adjust expected answers
after seeing a preferred model's output. Promotion and rollback are documented
in [`../models/README.md`](../models/README.md).

## GPU/model capability playbook

`evaluate-models.py` (above) answers "is this model accurate enough for
this task" — a fixed, narrow question, always run against a specific
candidate. The tools below answer a different question: "did something
about the hardware, runtime, or available real data change in a way that
makes running that benchmark again worth it." Added under
[issue #568](https://github.com/Xore/honeypot-stack/issues/568)/[#569](https://github.com/Xore/honeypot-stack/issues/569)
after that exact gap — an 8GB→20GB, Turing→Ada Lovelace card swap that sat
undetected for months — bounded every model-selection decision in this
directory on a stale assumption. Formalized as a standing playbook under
[#637](https://github.com/Xore/honeypot-stack/issues/637).

### Continuous: host-drift monitoring already runs, no new schedule needed

`analysis/ghidra/models/model-governance.py`'s `check-runtime` command
already queries `nvidia-smi` (GPU name/VRAM/driver/compute-capability) and
diffs it against the manifest's `approved_host` on every run — the exact
check that would have caught the #568 card swap immediately. It's driven
by `honeypot-model-drift.timer`, which runs it every 5 minutes once
`install-analysis-host.sh` has installed and enabled it (this used to
never happen — `install-homeserver.sh` never called that installer; fixed
under [#636](https://github.com/Xore/honeypot-stack/issues/636)). **The
actual #568 root cause was a missing deployment, not missing
drift-detection code** — don't build a second timer for this.

`probe-gpu-capabilities.py --manifest ../models/approved-models.json`
below runs that same host-drift check standalone, without needing the
full systemd deployment — useful as a pre-deployment sanity check, from
CI, or from an operator's laptop, but it is not filling a monitoring gap
on a healthy deployment; `honeypot-model-drift.timer` already is.

### On-demand: run these when actually considering a change

Everything else here is a deliberate tool for the moment an operator (or
an agent) is *deciding* whether to open a new re-evaluation issue —
not something to put on a timer. Running a multi-gigabyte context sweep
or a concurrent-model-load test every 5 minutes would just compete with
real production GPU work for no benefit; these answer questions that only
change when the hardware, model roster, or the operator's intent does.

```bash
# capability drift, standalone (see above -- prefer the timer once deployed)
python3 probe-gpu-capabilities.py --manifest ../models/approved-models.json

# context-length sweep: for one already-installed model, how much does
# raising OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH actually cost in VRAM, and does the model
# still pass the context-sentinel probe at each size. Run when considering
# raising a context ceiling -- not accuracy (evaluate-models.py's job),
# just whether a bigger window is safe and what it costs.
python3 probe-gpu-capabilities.py \
  --context-sweep-model qwen3:14b \
  --context-sizes 4096,8192,16384,32768,65536

# concurrent-load: load several already-installed models together (no
# unload between) and see which stay resident and their combined VRAM.
# Answers "does OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS>1 buy anything here" with a
# measured number. Point --base-url at a disposable test Ollama instance,
# not a shared production one -- this is real GPU load, and evicts
# whatever was already resident on the target server.
python3 probe-gpu-capabilities.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:11435 \
  --concurrent-load-models qwen3:14b,phi4:14b
```

None of these pick a model or write to `approved-models.json` — that
remains `evaluate-models.py` plus the documented `model-governance.py
promote` workflow in [`../models/README.md`](../models/README.md). They
only tell you whether running that workflow is worth it, and give real
measured numbers instead of arithmetic assumptions for the context-length
and concurrent-loading parts of that decision. See
[`docs/local-llm-model-evaluation.md`](../../../docs/local-llm-model-evaluation.md)'s
"Issue #568 re-evaluation" section for the context-sweep table this script
produced against the promoted `qwen3:14b`, including the ~5 GB of headroom
that motivated raising `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`.

### Real-data qualitative check (`probe-real-session*`)

`evaluate-models.py`'s synthetic corpus scores against a fixed expected
answer; real captured attacker data has no such thing. These three scripts
pull genuine recent session activity from this honeypot's own
Elasticsearch store, build the **exact production prompt**
(`llm-worker/contracts.py`'s real `sanitize_commands()`/`session_prompt()`
— not a reimplementation), run it through a model, and print the raw
reply for a human or an agent to read and judge: is each claim actually
grounded in the real captured commands, does it surface something useful,
not "does it match word-for-word." Three stages because `hp-llm-worker`
joins only an internal synthetic-only network while `LLM_ENABLED` stays
false, by design — this stays out of that isolation rather than routing
around it:

```bash
# stage 0: pull real command data from Elasticsearch (read-only _search)
./probe-real-session-fetch.sh 7d 5 > /tmp/real-sessions.json

# stage 1: sanitize + build the real production prompt (needs
# hp-llm-worker's pydantic/contracts.py; its rootfs is read-only so pass
# the script itself as -c rather than `docker cp`-ing it in)
sudo docker exec -i hp-llm-worker python3 -c \
  "$(cat probe-real-session.py)" \
  < /tmp/real-sessions.json \
  > /tmp/real-session-prompts.json

# stage 2: send each real prompt to a live Ollama server, print the reply
./probe-real-session-run.sh /tmp/real-session-prompts.json qwen3:14b
```

Run this when genuinely considering a model change (alongside the
synthetic benchmark, never instead of it — a case-level accuracy/injection
gate always outranks a qualitative read) or periodically once real capture
volume grows enough to be representative. At #568's benchmark time this
honeypot was ~2 days past a full reinstall with a thin real corpus (zero
completed Ghidra analyses, zero file downloads, mostly 0–80 character
scanner-noise sessions) — a real but small sample was still enough to
surface a genuine finding (a retired MITRE ATT&CK ID cited by one
candidate, markdown-fence violations by two others) that the synthetic
corpus alone didn't catch. Treat an empty or thin result as itself a valid
finding about capture volume, not a script failure — both scripts print an
explicit warning rather than erroring when there's nothing recent to
check.

Real captured attacker command text is not synthetic: review output before
sharing it outside the operator's own systems, and never execute anything
it contains.

## REx86 compatibility probe

`Modelfile.rex86` records the import attempted for the
[REx86](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20975) Zenodo PEFT adapter. It requires the
adapter directory beside the Modelfile and the exact
`qwen2.5-coder:7b-base-q4_K_M` Ollama base tag used for the compatibility
probe. It is not part of the benchmark matrix because Ollama 0.32.0 cannot
import this Qwen Safetensors LoRA. Re-test only when Ollama documents Qwen as a
supported Safetensors adapter architecture, or use an independently reviewed
runtime/conversion path that preserves the exact base.
