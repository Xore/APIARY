"""Which engine served a benchmark model: llama.cpp first, Ollama as fallback.

The harness has one transport (`evaluate-models.py`'s `request_json`) and one
record shape. This module sits between them so the engine decision never reaches
a scorer, and the harness calls it through the same signature it already had.

- **llama.cpp (primary).** `/app/llama-server` from
  `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:full-cuda`, one server per model, loaded from the
  GGUF the Ollama manifest already points at, answering `/v1/chat/completions`.
- **Ollama (fallback).** The `/api/chat` path that existed before, unchanged.

Three rules this module exists to enforce, each one a real incident:

**The KV retry fires only on a measured OOM.** `cudaMalloc failed`,
`out of memory`, a load failure naming VRAM -- and nothing else. A server that
stops for an unsupported architecture, a missing file or a bad flag must not be
retried: an unsupported architecture was nearly mistaken for insufficient VRAM,
and retrying there buys one identical second failure filed under the wrong
cause. `is_vram_oom()` is that whole rule, in one pure function.

**Fallback is a load decision, not a request decision.** Switching to Ollama
happens while starting the model or not at all. A failure *after* a successful
load is a measurement about that model (timeout, transport, a mid-answer 500)
and is raised as-is: silently re-asking Ollama would produce a second answer for
the same case and book one run as two. The two things a fallback cannot fix are
not absorbed either: a name that names no model, and a URL that is not an
Ollama, both fail on the fallback path for a reason that has nothing to do with
the model and are raised so the reader is sent to the actual cause.

**Everything that makes a number interpretable is recorded.** Engine, flags, KV
retry, fallback reason, achieved tokens/second, VRAM at the time. A result that
does not say which engine produced it cannot be compared against one that does.
The record names *both* endpoints, never one string standing in for two
servers: Ollama's `/api/chat` root and llama-server's `/v1/chat/completions`
have nothing in common but HTTP.

Translation note: the harness body is still built in Ollama's dialect, because
that is the body the transcript has always stored and every recorded field
(`was_capped`, `classify_outcome`, tool turns) is read off it.
`to_wire`/`from_wire` translate at the socket, so the stored body keeps one
shape across engines and no scorer's meaning changes with the engine.

Deliberately **not** a process-wide singleton: the harness keeps a plain
transport callable, so a test can substitute one, and a module-level singleton
would be exactly the un-stubable global this suite avoids.

    `json_object` carrying the schema under `schema` is the chosen mapping rather

    only content is the same schema.

        one line at load:

            load_tensors: offloaded 41/42 layers to GPU

        and sizes the buffers per device:

            load_tensors:        CUDA0 model buffer size = 17880.66 MiB
            llama_context: n_ctx                 = 24576
            llama_kv_cache:      CUDA0 KV buffer size =    480.00 MiB

        These are measurements, so they are what the record carries. A flag is
        a request, and copying the requested `-ngl` into a field named
        "layers in VRAM" would be a guess dressed as a fact.

        There are several of those lines in one log, not one. Fit loads a
        throwaway probe model to measure device memory before the real weights,
        and the probe prints its own placement:

            common_params_fit_impl: getting device memory data for initial parameters:
            load_tensors: offloaded 42/42 layers to GPU
            load_tensors:        CUDA0 model buffer size =     0.00 MiB
            ...
            load_tensors: offloaded  1/42 layers to GPU
            ...
            load_tensors: offloaded 0/42 layers to GPU      <- the real placement

        Only the last one describes the model that serves, so that is the one
        read, along with the buffer sizes printed after it. The count alone is
        not enough either: it is emitted before allocation, so the probe reads
        `42/42` next to `0.00 MiB`. A count that a zero-sized buffer contradicts
        is reported as zero layers -- nothing reached the card.

        Ignore `CPU_Mapped model buffer size`: it reports the mmap'd file and
        appears in a healthy 41/42 run too, so its presence means nothing.

        The measurement is cached on first read, because the log only exists
        while the container does. `provenance()` is called from `close()` and
        read again by the report after `teardown()` has removed the container,
        and a re-read there returns an empty log -- which is how 28 records came
        to carry `gpu_layers: null` next to an engine that had plainly
        offloaded to the card. So the first read wins, and only a caller with no

        which engine produced it, with which flags, whether the KV retry fired,
        whether and why Ollama took over, and what the card held at the time.

        `engine`, `fallback_engine` and `fallback_reason` are read live off this

        wait) comes from `self.server` while the server is up and from the
        snapshot taken at open() time once it is not. Both paths build the same
        key set, because a reader comparing two rows must not have to know which
        engine skipped a field.

        The snapshot is what makes a read after close() correct: close() tears the
        server down and clears the handle, so a read that trusted `self.server`
        alone reported a llama.cpp run as an Ollama one -- the misattribution
        that makes a mixed-engine table unreadable.
