"""llama.cpp serves the benchmark; Ollama is the fallback; the KV retry is an OOM.

The engine change is decided entirely by how a model loads, and the three ways
that can go wrong are the three that produced wrong answers before:

1. **The retry fires on something that is not an OOM.** An unsupported
   architecture was nearly mistaken for insufficient VRAM. Retrying that case
   spends a second identical load and files the real cause under VRAM, so the
   retry is authorised by exactly one predicate and these tests drive that
   predicate both ways -- including on text that merely mentions memory.
2. **A model is routed by what it looks like.** Never by parameter count, tag or
   filename: a wrong guess there is the same class of bug. These tests assert
   llama.cpp is attempted for models of every size class and that a *failed
   attempt* is what routes to Ollama, not a prediction.
3. **A result that does not say which engine served it.** Engine, flags, KV
   retry, fallback reason, achieved tok/s and VRAM all have to reach the record,
   because a tok/s column read across two engines at 6x the decode cost is the
   table that becomes meaningless.

The engine seam itself has to be translation-correct or nothing else matters:
   - `done_reason` must come back as `stop`/`length`, because
     `classify_outcome` and `was_capped` read it and an untranslated
     finish_reason scores cap-cut text as a real answer;
   - the llama.cpp tok/s must be computed from the same nanosecond field the
     Ollama path divides by 1e9;
   - the tool-round loop must run on llama.cpp too, not only on the fallback.

No llama.cpp, no GPU, no network and no containers: `Remote`, the container
launch and `urlopen` are all stubbed, and the assertions read the argv, the
bodies and the stored records.
