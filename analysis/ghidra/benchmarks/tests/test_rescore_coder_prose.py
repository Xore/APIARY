"""A rescore must see what a live run saw: the coder scorer's own words.

`rescore_from()` rebuilds the coder scorer's `raw` by hand from a stored
transcript record. `chat()` records the model's words twice, under two keys
that are NOT interchangeable -- `content` is assistant_text(), which falls
back to serializing tool_calls when a turn produced no prose, and `prose` is
the model's own words. `_pending_coder_case()` and
write_coder_artifact_file() read `prose`.

When the rescore rebuilt only `content`, both consumers read "" on every
rescored run. Two failures, both silent:
  * the degenerate-repetition gate never fired, so a looping model scored as
    if it had answered;
  * no source file was written at all, so a rescored coder run yielded zero
    gradeable artifacts -- only compile-report.json.

These tests drive the real producer (chat() -> SlotRecorder ->
TranscriptWriter) and the real consumer (rescore_from()), so neither the
transcript fixture nor the expected shape can drift from what production does.
