"""A generation that hit the output cap is never recorded as a successful run.

Before this, evaluate-models.py captured `done_reason` from every Ollama
response and then dropped it on the floor: the record's outcome was
`"error" if error else "ok"`, so `done_reason: "length"` -- Ollama's word for
"generation stopped at num_predict" -- was stored as `ok`. Every consumer
filters on `outcome != "ok"`, so a half-written answer was invisible
downstream and scored as a full one.

Measured on the committed runs: all 940 records with `done_reason: "length"`
carry `output_tokens == 512` exactly, while the longest answer that stopped on
its own is 488 tokens. The cap, not the model, decided where those answers
ended.

These tests drive the real producer -- chat() against a stubbed transport,
written through SlotRecorder -- so they fail if the classification is ever
removed, inverted, or bypassed.

class SessionsBudgetQualificationStatusTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """The `unmeasured` marker answers to promotion state, not to evidence.

    `output_tokens: 2048` is what the harness has to send for the sessions
    slot -- `evaluate_slot()` compares `qualification_request` by exact
    equality, so a manifest declaring 512 cannot run the slot at all -- and it
    is the ceiling llm-worker clamps at, so it is a budget production can
    actually produce. Neither of those is a measurement. So the manifest
    carries `slots.sessions.qualification_status` to record that the approval
    does not rest on one.

    A committed run at 2048 now exists (run `2026-10-02-...b7230ed5`, qwen3:14b
    at the approved digest), so "nothing was ever measured at 2048" stopped
    being true of the tree. What did not change is promotion: that run is not
    approved, the owner has not promoted it, and nothing cites it. The marker
    stays.

    This test used to read the marker's life off that evidence -- a run
    appearing at the declared budget demanded deleting the marker. That is the
    wrong dependency. Producing a measurement and approving one are separate
    acts with separate owners, and collapsing them strips the admission on the
    strength of an unapproved run: an unqualified budget reading as approved,
    reached from the opposite side. So the marker is tied to promotion, which
    is what actually governs it.

    How far promotion state can be read from the tree.
    `model-governance.py promote` requires `--approval-date` and stamps
    `slot["approval"]` with it (`command_promote`), in the same write as the
    `report_sha256` of the report it just verified. An approval therefore
    cannot predate the run that produced its report, which makes the recorded
    `approval.date` against the earliest run captured at the declared budget a
    real question rather than a proxy. Today it answers no -- the approval
    predates every committed 2048 run, so it provably was not made from one,
    the slot is not promoted at the declared budget, and the marker must be
    present. Promoting the run moves `approval.date` onto or past that run's
    date and flips the answer, which is the point.

    The stronger oracle is unavailable, and this says so rather than papering
    over it. `verify-report` needs the archived report, and
    `approval.report_sha256` (70c394e8...) is deliberately not in the tree --
    `docs/local-llm-model-evaluation.md` records that verbose reports stay in
    the mode-0700 operator archive on the analysis host because they contain
    full model replies. So coverage cannot be re-derived, and the date
    ordering above is the strongest oracle the tree supports. That absence is
    asserted too: if the report is ever committed this goes red on purpose,
    because `verify_report` would then be strictly stronger and the check has
    to be upgraded rather than left standing on the weaker footing.

    Two-sided, as it always was. A slot promoted at 2048 must not go on
    claiming `unmeasured`; a slot that is not promoted must say so. Promotion
    is the only thing that may remove the marker.
