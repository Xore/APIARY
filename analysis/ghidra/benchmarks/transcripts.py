"""Full-conversation transcript records for benchmark model calls (issue #1805).

A score is a lossy summary of an answer. The questions that actually decide
model selection here -- "what did this model say that the other missed", "does
the security fine-tune surface a behaviour the base model never mentions" --
live in the answer text and cannot be reconstructed from a number. Re-running
is not a substitute: model tags, quants, sampling and prompts all drift, so a
re-run answers a different question than the original.

Two things #1805's claim-pool scoring requires are simply impossible if
transcripts are discarded:

1. Rescoring earlier rounds against a later, enlarged claim pool -- which needs
   the earlier models' original answers.
2. Computing unique-contribution retroactively, since "did this model find
   something no other model did" is defined against the set of models that ran
   and changes when a model is added later.

So the raw text is the durable artifact and the score is derived from it, not
the other way round.

Storage is split by the provenance of the INPUT, not by convenience:

- `synthetic` -- #159's corpus binaries and `evaluate-models.py`'s fixtures
  (TEST-NET addresses, reserved names, fake credentials, reviewed before
  commit), run against a model whose answers are themselves fixtures. Committed
  to the repo under `docs/benchmarks/runs/<date>-<run_id>/` so rounds stay
  comparable across time. There is no secret in them.
- `live_model` -- synthetic input, live answers. The prompts are still this
  repository's fixtures, which is what makes the transcripts committable, but
  they were answered by a real served model rather than replayed: a pinned
  artifact digest, a `done_reason` the harness did not choose, and an answer no
  one wrote by hand. It is a separate member rather than `synthetic` because
  reading a real measurement as a fixture answer is the error that lets a
  fabricated-looking result pass unexamined, and it is silent -- nothing
  downstream reads the field. It is *not* `captured`: nothing in such a run is
  attacker-supplied, so the reason `captured` is kept out of the working tree
  does not apply and the transcripts belong in the repo with the rest.
- `captured` -- runs against real honeypot data. These contain real attacker
  IPs and payloads, so they are written outside the repository with bounded
  retention and the issue carries only aggregates and pointers. Writing them
  into the working tree is refused here rather than left to reviewer vigilance.

The first two are committable and the third is not, so `PROVENANCES` orders the
committable members first and the refused one last: the tuple is also the
`--provenance` choices list, and the refusal below is the one value it has to
single out.

The committable half is a claim about the *input*, so the producers check it
rather than assert it: `assert_repository_fixture_input()` refuses a
`live_model` run whose prompt sources are not files in this tree, which is the
source-side twin of the destination-side refusal in `TranscriptWriter.__init__`.
A free argparse choice is what made the claim worthless; the enum member is
only worth having once something reads it.

This partly supersedes `docs/analysis/ghidra/benchmarks/README.md`, which tells
the operator to preserve the raw report outside the repository for everything.
That rule was written when the report was a score summary; it still governs
`captured` runs, and the other two now commit their transcripts instead.

    The prose counterpart to is_degenerate(), and a different measure because the
    two existing ones do not survive prose at a 16k budget:

    - `repetition_ratio` scores every fixed-width window, so legitimate
      structure accumulates score. Measured: 0.42 on 120 distinct sentences,
      0.56 on 200 distinct bullets -- both at or past the 0.60 threshold within
      doubling the length. At 4096 tokens that never happened; at 16000 a
      correct long answer reaches it.
    - `injection_gate.is_degenerate` normalises digits, so a correct ATT&CK
      list -- T1037.001 .. T1037.019 -- collapses to one repeated line. It
      flags a complete, correct sessions answer as degenerate. That is measured
      on a committed record, not hypothetical.

    Both therefore over-fire on exactly the answers a raise in budget was meant
    to buy. This one asks a narrower question -- is a *block* repeated? -- which
    is what a loop actually is, and which a long distinct answer never is
    however long it gets.

    Only the tail is examined. A loop starts somewhere and then never stops, so
    the last few thousand characters are where the repetition is unambiguous.

    A repetition that runs into the output budget is still a repetition, even
    though the budget cut it mid-block, so the trailing copy is allowed to be a
    partial one -- see the loop below for why, and
    tests/test_loop_detection.py for the offsets that were previously missed.
    What keeps a recovered answer from being flagged is unchanged and is the
    honest call: the differing tail breaks the alignment.

    Measured over all 1,503 committed analysis-slot records: 15 flagged, all
    `done_reason: length`, zero flags on any answer that finished on its own
    terms. That count is unchanged by accepting a partial trailing copy -- the
