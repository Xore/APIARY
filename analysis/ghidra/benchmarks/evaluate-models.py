# --- Request timeout, sized by the work the request asks for ----------------
# The flat 300s this replaces was one wall-clock allowance for an 8-token
# context probe and for the coder slot's 4096-token answer alike, so on the
# homeserver (RTX 4000 Ada, 20 GB VRAM, ~92 GB RAM) any model decoding slower
# than ~7 tok/s could not finish a 4096-token budget inside it. Measured there
# at num_predict: 256:
#     GLM-4.6-REAP-218B IQ1_S   2.71 tok/s  ->  4096 tokens needs 25.2 min
#     Trendyol Qwen3-32B Q8_0   2.45 tok/s  ->  4096 tokens needs 27.9 min
#     Seneca 32B Q4_Medium      5.12 tok/s  ->  4096 tokens needs 13.3 min
# Those models were excluded by a transport timeout rather than by any property
# of the model, which is what a timeout is not. Lowering the budget they are
# asked for would fix the symptom by changing what the benchmark measures.
#
# So the allowance is computed from the request's own num_predict at a floor
# decode rate, and clamped. 2.0 tok/s sits below the slowest rate measured
# above, so a model at that floor still has the wall clock left over for
# prefill and for a cold load -- the 2048s a 4096-token budget buys against
# 25-28 min of measured decode is exactly that margin. It is a constant rather
# than a flag because the only caller that has to size a wait is the one below:
# the second transport in this tree, corpus/record_baseline.py, already carries
# its own, and a flag nobody sets is a number with two sources of truth.
#
# The clamps keep both ends honest. A short request still fails fast at the old
# 300s instead of hanging on a stalled server, and no caller can buy an
# unbounded wait. The ceiling is derived from the largest declared budget at the
# same headroom ratio the flat 3600 carried -- 3600 / (4096 / 2.0) = 1.7578 --
# so raising a budget cannot silently reintroduce the old defect as a timeout
# stop, which is the same answer ending mid-sentence for a different reason.
# CODER_NUM_PREDICT stands in for the largest budget in OUTPUT_BUDGETS. All four
# slots are 16000 now, so naming the coder one is naming the same number four
# times over; the table is built further down because its siblings
# (ANALYSIS_/SESSIONS_) are declared there. 16000 / 2.0 * 1.7578 = 14063s.

    a slot: an endpoint that is absent (an older server), a transport failure, a

#   * the structured-output grammar (`format`) is silently not applied, so
#     JSON compliance comes from the prompt contract every slot already
#     carries ("Return JSON with exactly these keys");
#   * `think: false` does not suppress analysis -- it empties it, returning
#     content:"" with tokens burned invisibly (the #2233 raw-output signature:
#     sessions 10/67, parsed null, done_reason often null);
#   * greedy decoding at temperature 0 can spiral inside the analysis channel
#     on rule-dense MITRE prompts (looping taxonomy second-guessing), which a
#     wider anti-repetition window breaks without touching the prompt.

#
# One budget for all four slots. The analysis slots were held at 4096 (ghidra,
# revdeck) and 2048 (sessions) while the coder slot ran at 16000, and the
# 2026-10-04 roster run measured what the gap buys: 7 revdeck answers on
# baronllm-llama3.1:q6_k ended at exactly 4096 output_tokens, all of them
# `done_reason: length`, cycling two bullets for 3,625 words. The sessions slot
# was pinned lower still -- 2048 is the ceiling `llm-worker/worker.py` clamps
# at (`env_int("LLM_OUTPUT_TOKENS", 512, 128, 2048)`), so its budget described
# a production worker rather than this harness. All four are now the same
# number, which also means MAX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS below still derives off
# the largest budget and still needs no change.
ANALYSIS_NUM_PREDICT = 16000   # ghidra triage, revdeck, context probe
SESSIONS_NUM_PREDICT = 16000

# num_ctx is the hard ceiling, not num_predict: Ollama clamps the answer to
# what fits in the window, so a budget larger than num_ctx minus the prompt is
# cut silently -- by the window, not the cap -- which is indistinguishable from
# a model failure in the transcript (done_reason: length). This used to be a
# per-slot decision that only the coder slot got right: `CODER_NUM_CTX = 18400`
# for coder against a bare `min(context, 8192)` for sessions and revdeck, so
# raising those budgets above 6075 without raising the window would have
# reproduced the silent truncation at a different number. One constant now,
# owned here beside the budgets it has to cover.
#
# 24576 = the 16000 budget plus the widest prompt this harness sends, rounded
# up. The widest is the ghidra slot's context probe, not a case: 420 filler
# lines plus TRIAGE_SYSTEM is 15,209 chars, ~7,176 tokens at the 2.12
# chars/token measured on the one committed record that stored both (revdeck
# `tlv_parser`, 4,487 chars / 2,117 prompt_tokens). 16000 + 7176 = 23176, so
# the old 18400 coder window is 4,776 short of covering it -- which is why this
# is not the coder's number renamed. The widest real case is revdeck at ~2,512.
#
# Sized against a *first* prompt, which was the second way this was wrong. The
# coder slot is multi-round and round 2 does not send round 1's prompt, so the
# window has to cover the widest continuation prompt instead -- and that prompt
# grew with the previous answer, because _continuation_prompt re-sent it whole.
# Measured: 65,209 chars, ~16,302 tokens, so 16000 + 16302 = 32,302 against this
# window, and every model that spent its budget was window-truncated from round
# 2 on -- silently, by the window rather than the cap, reading as a model
# failure. _continuation_prompt now delegates the prior state to read_file
# instead of re-sending it, so the widest coder prompt is the continuation at
# 6,514 chars (~3,073 tokens) and 16000 + 3073 = 19,073 fits with 5,503 spare;
# the window does not have to move for that. Both numbers are asserted per slot
# in tests/test_truncation_outcome.py, against the real prompts, so a later
# change to either text is caught before it silently overflows again.
#
# Raising num_ctx costs KV cache, for four slots now instead of one. llama.cpp
# already spills KV to system RAM off the card on its own (measured 0.97 GB
# offload at num_ctx 16384), so this is not an "offload to RAM" switch -- that is
# the default behaviour. The lever is bytes-per-token: the ghidra ollama
# container sets OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0, which makes f16-sized context fit in
# 1/1.88 the VRAM; at 18400 a 27B needs ~1.99 GiB of KV, so 24576 is ~2.66 GiB.
# Both fit the 20475 MiB card, and qwen3:14b at context=32768 is already
# measured loading at ~14.1 GB in analysis/ghidra/docker-compose.ghidra.yml, so
# this needs no container change. Measure with
# analysis/ghidra/benchmarks/probe-gpu-capabilities.py before raising again.

    Why the previous answer is not re-sent whole: `_continuation_prompt` used
    to re-embed the entire last answer, and at the 16000-token coder budget a
    full-budget answer is ~64,000 chars, so the continuation prompt measured
    65,209 chars (~16,302 tokens) and a round-2 request needed 32,302 tokens
    against a 24,576 window. From round 2 on a model that spent its budget
    was window-truncated *silently* -- cut by the window rather than the cap,
    which reads as a model failure (`done_reason: length`) and is exactly the
    defect NUM_CTX was raised to remove. Truncating the prior answer instead
    would re-introduce the owner's complaint verbatim ("do not simply resend
    the whole source code as answer"), so the fix removes the re-send rather
    than shrinking it.

    The prior answer is not dropped, it is delegated: `read_file` returns the
    bytes that are actually on disk, which is a truer copy of the work than a
    chat re-send (it is what will be graded) and one the model did not have to
    spend tokens emitting. So the model still iterates *through the code* --
    which is what the owner asked for -- rather than against a transcript of
    it, and the prompt is a bounded function of the case rather than of the
    round.

    The text is deliberately an iteration protocol, not a request to review
    code: read the file, walk the requirements, fix them one at a time, read it
    back, and declare done only when a re-read shows nothing left to change.
    `previous` is kept in the signature because the round transcript records
    it, not because this prompt inlines it.

    Stored transcripts hold raw model output, not a score -- scoring always
    happened at evaluate_slot() time, against whatever scorer revision was
    live then. This function is the missing other half: it groups records
    back into the same (case, workflow) shapes _score_session_case(),
    _score_triage_case() and _score_revdeck_case() were extracted to accept,
    and calls them directly -- so a rescore can never compute anything
    differently from what a live run with today's code would have scored.

    Never writes into run_dir; stored transcripts are append-only by policy
    (transcripts.py's TranscriptWriter already refuses to reopen an existing
    path for exactly this reason).

    To see what a scorer change moved (the issue's "old vs new" ask): run
    this once on the pre-change commit (`git worktree add` or `git stash`),
    once on the post-change commit, and diff the two JSON reports -- the
    `scorer_git_sha` each carries makes the two sides unambiguous. There is
    no "old score" stored anywhere to diff against automatically; the
    published report at the time was the only prior record; a JSONL of raw
    answers was never such a record.

    A stored record is admitted or refused on its own evidence -- the
    done_reason and error it carries -- rather than on the `outcome` field
    beside them, because the 940 committed records the 512 cap cut still read
    `outcome: "ok"` (test_committed_reclassification.py is the inventory).
    Otherwise this is the one path the reclassification still leaks through,
