"""Drain the Ghidra analysis request spool.

The dashboard writes {sha256}.request into GHIDRA_REQUEST_DIR and never talks
to the Ghidra REST service itself — same trust boundary as the sandbox
workers, and for the same reason: a dashboard RCE must not reach the analysis
infrastructure. A systemd path unit notices the new file and runs this script,
which analyses each pending sample and writes {sha256}_ghidra.json into
GHIDRA_RESULTS_DIR for the dashboard to read back.

Mirrors sandbox/windows/run_pending.sh in the ways that matter:

  * a non-blocking lock, so overlapping path-unit triggers collapse into one
    drain instead of running several analyses at once;
  * a request moved out of the spool *before* it runs, so a crash cannot
    replay the same sample forever;
  * the hash re-validated here rather than trusted from the spool, because
    this worker holds the credentials and the dashboard does not.

Stdlib only, deliberately: this runs on the host outside any container, and a
worker that needs pip install before it can drain a queue is a worker that
will be broken after the next OS upgrade.

API CONTRACT — verified 2026-07-31 against
biniamfd/ghidra-headless-rest:1.2.1 (Ghidra 11.3.2, artifact schema 2.1) by
running a real binary through it. The endpoints originally taken from the plan
documents were wrong; see GhidraClient for what the service actually exposes.
Re-check with --selftest after any image change.

The worker talks to exactly two services, both of which must be local: the
Ghidra REST service above, and an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint for AI
triage (#103). The triage evidence is text lifted out of a captured sample, so
endpoint_is_local() refuses to send it anywhere but this host or its network.

#   * b"expa" (4 bytes) and DE AD BE EF (4 bytes) were separate signatures.
#     Four bytes is far too short: 0xDEADBEEF is a ubiquitous sentinel in
#     ordinary software, and "expa" is both a prefix of the ChaCha constant
#     and common text. Both would have fired on benign binaries constantly.
#
#   * SHA-256's K table was packed big-endian. On x86 these are stored
#     little-endian: the big-endian form scores 0 hits against libcrypto.so.3
#     while the little-endian form scores 5. SHA-256 detection could never
