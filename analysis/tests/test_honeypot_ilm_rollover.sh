# Tests for the honeypot-30d ILM policy analysis/elasticsearch-setup.sh
# installs (#585: without an explicit rollover action, ILM cannot delete a
# data stream's write index -- the delete phase gets permanently stuck at
# "wait-for-shard-history-leases" and the single backing index grows
# unbounded forever, so the stated 30-day retention did nothing at all).
#
# Runs a real Elasticsearch container and forces ILM's own periodic poll
# down to a few seconds so the full rollover-then-delete lifecycle can be
# observed end to end in well under a minute, with no manual _rollover call
# standing in for what ILM does automatically in production. Needs Docker
# and the ability to pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch; skips cleanly if
# either is unavailable, same convention as
# analysis/yara/tests/test_sync_yara.sh.
#
# Usage: analysis/tests/test_honeypot_ilm_rollover.sh
