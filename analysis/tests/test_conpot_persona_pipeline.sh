# Runs a real Elasticsearch container and uses its

# (#563) for why there's no lighter-weight Painless test harness. Needs
# Docker and the ability to pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch; skips

# port above is a fixed random draw rather than an ephemeral bind, so a
# survivor can also collide with a later run outright. Verified live on the
