// composable-templates.js -- run by arkime-init either side of db.pl (#3343).
//
// Arkime's db.pl installs LEGACY index templates (arkime_sessions3_template,
// arkime_sessions3_ecs_template, arkime_history_v1_template) and re-installs
// them on every init/upgrade run. Elasticsearch applies no legacy template to
// an index once ANY composable template matches it, and this cluster always
// has one: elasticsearch-setup.sh's single-node-replica-default matches "*".
// (It used to carry "-arkime_sessions3-*" alongside, hoping to exclude Arkime;
// composable templates have no exclusion syntax, so those were literal index
// names matching nothing and the claim was false. #3343 removed them rather
// than leaving the comment asserting a mechanism that does not exist.)
// Every arkime_sessions3-* index was therefore created from dynamic defaults --
// firstPacket as long instead of date, node/tags as text, no wordSplit
// analyzer, no dynamic templates.
//
// Two subcommands, run either side of db.pl by honeypot-init/compose.yml:
//
//   shadow    before db.pl: delete every composable template that would cover
//             an Arkime index family -- the two generated below, the #1191
//             arkime-sessions3-ip-fix fragment on clusters that predate them,
//             and single-node-replica-default -- stashing each body first.
//             Decided by glob, not by name, so a renamed or added catch-all is
//             covered too.
//   generate  after db.pl (no argument): read the live legacy templates, merge
//             them the way Elasticsearch merges legacy templates, install one
//             composable template per family, then put everything the shadow
//             stashed back.
//
// Why the shadow cannot be skipped: a composable template covering those
// families is exactly what makes db.pl's own template installation fail.
//
//   illegal_argument_exception: legacy template [arkime_sessions3_template] has
//   index patterns [arkime_sessions3-*] matching patterns from existing
//   composable templates [arkime-sessions3, single-node-replica-default] --
//   use composable templates (/_index_template) instead
//
// Only a CREATE is refused. Re-PUTting a legacy template whose index patterns
// are unchanged is only a warning -- ES 9.5's
// MetadataIndexTemplateService.innerPutTemplate takes the "may be ignored in
// favor of a composable template" branch whenever isUpdateAndPatternsAreUnchanged
// holds -- so a steady-state redeploy survives even unshadowed. `db.pl init` is
// the case that is not: it DELETEs all three legacy templates and creates them
// again, and it is exactly what a fresh cluster and a half-finished earlier
// deploy both need. So a single composable template left behind by a failed
// run refuses init, the next deploy fails the same way, and the stack can
// never finish initialising again without a hand-deleted template: the thing
// that would have to be cleaned up is created by the one-shot that already
// succeeded. Shadowing makes that self-healing; the retry in compose.yml
// covers the one race a shadow cannot -- a template created *while* db.pl runs.
//
// The generated templates translate Arkime's live legacy templates into one
// composable template per index family, merged the way Elasticsearch merges
// legacy templates (ascending order, later wins; dynamic_templates by name),
// plus the three things this cluster needs on top: number_of_replicas 0
// (single node, #3283), ip-typed source.ip/destination.ip (the viewer's
// fixSessionFields crashes on text IPs, #1191), and delete-only retention on
// the sessions family (#3283). Regenerated on every arkime-init run, so it
// follows whatever templates the running Arkime version's db.pl installed.
//
// #3283 retention, and why it lives here rather than in
// elasticsearch-setup.sh next to the other twelve policies:
//
//   * It was missing. Every daily index family in this stack is ILM-managed
//     except arkime_sessions3-*, which grew one index a day forever. #3362
//     removed the dominant term (Zeek's 84 per-day families became 84 per
//     month) and this was the last unbounded one left, so the shard
//     arithmetic still had a term that only ever adds. That is one more way
//     the single node reaches cluster.max_shards_per_node's 1000 default and
//     dead-letters all sensor ingest, as it did on 2026-09-21.
//   * The policy has to exist BEFORE the template that names it, and this
//     script is the only thing that installs that template. Elasticsearch
//     validates index.lifecycle.name at index creation, so a template
//     naming a policy that is not there yet fails the creation outright --
//     and arkime-init and elasticsearch-setup are independent one-shots that
//     race (elasticsearch-setup.sh waits for db.pl's legacy template because
//     of the mirror-image problem). A policy created in elasticsearch-setup
//     could not be relied on to exist before arkime-capture creates an
//     index, and arkime-capture waits only on arkime-init.done, not on
//     elasticsearch-setup.done. Creating the policy here, immediately before
//     the template that references it, is the ordering that cannot lose.
//   * The age is HONEYPOT_RETENTION_DAYS, the same single knob every other
//     window in this stack scales from (#261), passed into this container by
//     honeypot-init/compose.yml. Same window as the raw event stream rather
//     than suricata-7d's 7/30 share: the Arkime viewer and the Kibana "Arkime
//     Sessions" data view (docs/OPERATIONS.md) are supported workflows, and
//     21 shards is not the problem -- unbounded growth was.
//
// A composable template only governs indices created AFTER it is installed,
// so the run also adopts the arkime_sessions3-* indices already on disk.
// Adoption never overwrites an index that carries some other lifecycle name:
// that is an operator's deliberate choice, and this one-shot init job's log
// is the only place a warning about it can surface.
//
// DRY_RUN=1 prints the policy, the generated templates and the adoption
// plan, and changes nothing.
//
// Node 22 (shipped in the Arkime image), no dependencies. Exits non-zero on
// any failure so arkime-init's `set -e` never writes its done-marker over a
// half-applied state.
