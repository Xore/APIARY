//! On-demand payload-bytes mirror, ported from payload_bytes_es.go's
//! mirrorOnePayloadBytes. dashboard-payload-bytes-v1 is normally kept warm
//! by payload-inventory-worker's own periodic scan; this is the self-heal
//! path for a hash this replica hasn't seen mirrored yet, so a static-
//! analysis/detail read never has to wait on that worker's next cycle.
//!
//! Simplified from the Go tier: no fingerprint (size+mtime) staleness
//! check — a document once mirrored is treated as good indefinitely, same
//! as every other read this crate serves from dashboard-payload-bytes-v1
//! today. A capture's bytes changing after the fact under the same hash
//! would be unusual (defeats the point of content-addressed storage) and
//! isn't handled here; follow-up if that turns out to matter live.
