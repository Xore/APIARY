//! Background worker loops (#1610), ported from the Go dashboard's
//! embedded producers. Enabled per-role via WORKER_LOOPS (comma list;
//! empty = pure API role), so the same image serves as API replica or
//! worker on any docker host — stateless, env-configured, all state in
//! ES (per Xore's cross-host requirement).
//!
//! Currently ported: `alert-notifier` — the notifyLoop/alertManager pair
//! (store.go/alerts.go): every alert signal store.go's notifyLoop combines,
//! ES-derivable and host-local alike (#1612 finished the latter: log-stream
//! sizes, sandbox/ghidra/cape/github-analysis spool health, filebeat stats,
//! OT command detection), upserted into dashboard-alert-state-v1 with
//! cooldown + optional webhook. The host-local signals need this loop's
//! container (backend-worker) to have the same bind mounts/service URLs the
//! Go dashboard had — see compose.yml's backend-worker volumes/environment.
//! `user-retention-sweep` (#1612) — orphaned preference expiry (roadmap
//! Milestone F), ported from userStore.SweepRetention: no in-memory cache to
//! poll here, so this just re-reads the users doc on its own interval rather
//! than the Go store's 3s poll tick.
//! `threat-intel` (#1659) — Tor-exit/reputation-blocklist CIDR
//! classification, ported from geoip.go's intel matching; see
//! threat_intel.rs's own doc comment.
//! #1750 adds ingestion-lag alerting to `alert-notifier` — the one signal
//! the Go tier never had, and the one that would have caught a 45-hour
//! blackout nothing else noticed. See INGEST_FEEDS below.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// #1750 — ingestion-lag alerting.
//
// #1678's stall was silent for three days: `hp-filebeat` was up, the container
// has no healthcheck that tests ingestion, and other Suricata sub-types kept
// flowing, so every "is it running" check passed while `suricata-v2-alert-*`
// received nothing. The signal has to come from the data.
//
// Two signals, because neither alone is enough — measured against this fleet's
// own history rather than assumed:
//
//   * Freshness. Newest real document older than the index's threshold. This
//     catches total silence, and it is what #1750 proposed.
//
//   * Volume collapse. Last hour far below the index's own recent baseline.
//     This is the one #1750 did not ask for, and the one that matters most.
//     Between 2026-08-20 21:00 and 2026-08-22 18:00 honeypot-v2-* fell from
//     ~100k events/hour to ~9, for 45 hours, and nobody noticed. Freshness
//     would not have caught a second of it: a handful of sensors kept
//     trickling, so the longest gap in real traffic across those 45 hours was
//     1h20m — inside normal variation. Volume collapse fires on the first
//     hour, on 3 events against a 102,956/h baseline.
//
// Both signals ignore `internal_probe` traffic (#1677/#1767). That is not a
// refinement, it is what makes the check work at all: during those same 45
// hours the index kept receiving a loopback healthcheck every nine seconds, so
// anything counting raw documents saw a perfectly healthy index.
//
// Thresholds are per index because rates differ by three orders of magnitude,
// and each was read off 14 days of that index's own history (2026-08-09 to
// 2026-08-23, probes excluded) rather than guessed. Over that window, at 90
// minutes, the only index that fires on natural variation is
// suricata-v2-dns-*, and the only fire anywhere else is dionaea's real 47-hour
// outage. The two indices with longer thresholds are the two that needed them:
//
//   index                     longest natural gap    threshold
//   honeypot-v2-*                          1h20m           90m
//   dionaea-incidents-v1-*                     -           90m
//   portbridge-v2-*                            -           90m
//   suricata-v2-alert-* and peers              -           90m
//   suricata-v2-smtp-*                     1h00m          120m
//   suricata-v2-dns-*                      2h00m          180m
//
// Alerting is per feed rather than per index: the ten Suricata sub-types come
// from one eve input, and an input dying should page once naming the ten, not
// ten times. The message names which members are stalled, so #1678's shape
// (one starved index while its nine siblings flow) still reads clearly.
