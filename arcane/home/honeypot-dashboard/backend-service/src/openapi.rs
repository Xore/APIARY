//! The machine-readable contract for this service's HTTP surface (#3325).
//!
//! # Where the document comes from
//!
//! From the `Router`. Every handler carries a `#[utoipa::path]`
//! annotation, and `utoipa_axum::routes!(handler)` reads it to register
//! the handler in the served router *and* the document in one call. There
//! is no second route table and no second copy of the surface.
//!
//! The one way that stops being true is registering a route the old way --
//! `OpenApiRouter` inherits `axum::Router`'s `.route(...)` as a pass-through
//! that reaches the process and not the document -- so
//! `contract_covers_every_router_route` names those three methods and fails
//! the build if the table contains one. In the other direction, an
//! annotation on a handler nothing routes publishes an operation the service
//! answers 404 for, and the same test catches that.
//!
//! This file used to hold an 1820-line hand-written table of the same
//! surface, kept honest by two drift tests. That had rotted twice, and
//! the reason is structural rather than a matter of care: a table beside
//! the router is a second thing to update, and the direction that rots is
//! the one where the new route never reaches it. The annotations are on
//! the handlers, so the surface is described once.
//!
//! # The transform, and what it is for
//!
//! `utoipa` gives the document its shape, and [`render`] applies a short,
//! documented set of adjustments to it. Each one exists because the
//! information is real and `utoipa` cannot see it -- not to make the output
//! prettier, and not to paper over an annotation that was forgotten:
//!
//! 1. **The middleware's 401.** `require_service_token` answers
//!    `(StatusCode, String)` *before a route is resolved*, so no handler
//!    can see the status it causes and no handler can annotate it. Every
//!    operation that declares `security(("serviceToken" = []))` is
//!    therefore given the `text/plain` 401 here. An operation that can
//!    also answer a JSON 401 of its own -- the Workbench's
//!    `require_actor` -- keeps it in its own annotation, and the two
//!    media types are merged onto one status rather than overwriting each
//!    other.
//! 2. **`operationId` and the operation's tag.** Both are pure functions
//!    of the path, so they are computed once in [`operation_id`] and
//!    [`tag_for`] rather than written out 141 times where a typo would
//!    rename a published id.
//! 3. **`Option` is an absence, not a null.** A parameter declared
//!    `Option<T>` is an absent-or-`T` parameter, and `required: false`
//!    already says so; `utoipa` renders a header's `Option<String>` as
//!    `["string", "null"]` anyway, and a header value is text on the wire,
//!    never the JSON value null. So the `null` is dropped from the type.
//!    A *body* is the other way round: `utoipa` does not derive `required`
//!    for a request body at all, so the two routes that take an
//!    `Option<Json<T>>` carry an `x-optional-body` marker in their
//!    annotation and this file turns it into `required: false` and consumes
//!    the marker. `document_is_well_formed` asserts no marker survives.
//! 4. **The operation description.** `utoipa` reads each handler's Rust
//!    doc comment into the operation. Those comments are written for Rust
//!    readers, and the contract carries a summary per operation, so the
//!    description is dropped here rather than published as a second,
//!    differently-worded summary of the same route.
//! 5. **The document-level literals** -- `info`'s title, version, summary
//!    and description, `servers`, the `serviceToken` security scheme, and
//!    the tag list. `OpenApiRouter::default()` starts empty on purpose
//!    (`new()` would fill `info` in from utoipa's own Cargo.toml), and
//!    `utoipa`'s `Info` does not model `summary` at all. These are prose
//!    about the service, not facts about any one route, so they stay here
//!    where a reader looks for them; the tag *descriptions* are a function
//!    of the tag name in [`tag_description`].
//! 6. **`parameters: []` on an operation that takes none.** `utoipa`
//!    omits the key, and "omitted" and "none" are different answers to a
//!    consumer walking the document.
//!
//! Every one of the four document-level facts the fuzz job checks -- the
//! auth tier, the request parameters, the declared statuses, and the
//! media type of every response -- is generator *input*, carried in the
//! annotations. The list above is the whole of what is added here, and
//! `document_is_well_formed` asserts each of them rather than trusting
//! this prose.
//!
//! # What the document deliberately does NOT claim
//!
//! **Every** success body is free-form (an empty schema, which accepts any
//! JSON value) -- including `/healthz`'s two-field struct. Hand-transcribing
//! 141 response shapes would be 141 chances to assert something the code
//! does not enforce, and a contract that lies about a response is worse
//! than one that admits it is open. The empty schema is the truthful
//! statement: it is also what keeps `response_schema_conformance` from
//! failing the fuzz job on correct behaviour, which is why that job
//! reports service findings like "API accepted schema-violating request"
//! and treats them as a standing record rather than as a verdict.
//!
//! # Statuses that no annotation has to remember
//!
//! Three come from axum's extractors, before any handler runs, and the
//! annotations that take such a body or a `Query` declare them:
//! `Json<T>` adds 415 and 422, and `Query<T>` adds 400. Running the fuzz
//! job against a booted service is what found all three -- they are
//! unreachable from the router's source, since nothing in `router()` or
//! the handlers mentions them, and every one of them was reported
//! "undocumented" on routes whose rows looked complete.
//!
//! One status carries two media types on the routes where the extractor's
//! answer and the handler's own answer share a code: the Workbench's 400
//! is `text/plain` when `Query<T>` refuses the query string and
//! `application/json` when the handler rejects the value.

const INFO_DESCRIPTION: &str = "\
The /api surface of `backend-service/` (`apiary-backend`), the Rust service \
tier of the APIARY dashboard's modernization port (#1608). It is not a \
public API: the Nitro BFF in `frontend-next/` is the only intended caller \
and presents a shared service token on every /api/v1 route. /healthz and \
/metrics are the two exceptions, open on purpose for the container \
healthcheck and the #1972 metrics scrape.

Response bodies are deliberately left unconstrained here. The handlers \
return `Json<Value>` or a per-surface struct that nothing in this crate \
enforces, so restating 138 shapes would be 138 chances to publish \
something the code does not promise -- and a contract that lies about a \
response is worse than one that admits the gap. What this document does \
pin is the part that has been wrong before: the auth tier, the request \
parameters (including the enum-valued ones the handlers actually \
validate), the declared status codes, and the media type of every \
response. That is what `.github/workflows/weekly-schemathesis.yml` \
checks.

`arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/backend-service/src/openapi.rs` is the \
source of truth. Regenerate the committed copy with \
`cargo run --bin openapi > openapi.json`; the drift tests in that module \
and a diff step in `quality.yml` both fail if you forget.";
