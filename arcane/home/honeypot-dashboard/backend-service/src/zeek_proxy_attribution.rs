//! Resolve the real attacker behind a zeek-proxy observation.
//!
//! zeek-proxy watches `wg0`, where every flow is `10.8.0.1 -> 10.8.0.2`: the
//! VPS forwarding inward. That is genuinely what crossed the wire, so the
//! sensor is not wrong — but a record whose `source.ip` is our own tunnel is
//! useless as attacker attribution, and reads on the dashboard as though our
//! infrastructure were attacking itself.
//!
//! portbridge logs both halves of every relayed connection: `community_id`
//! for the attacker's tuple as it arrived on the public NIC, and
//! `community_id_relayed` for the tunnel-side tuple it dialled inward. The
//! second is what zeek-proxy computes for the same flow, so one is a key into
//! the other.
//!
//! # The key is not unique, and that is the whole difficulty
//!
//! The relayed tuple is `10.8.0.1:<ephemeral> -> 10.8.0.2:<service>`, and the
//! ephemeral port is reused within seconds under this traffic. Measured on the
//! live cluster: one `community_id_relayed` matched four portbridge records
//! belonging to different attackers. Joining on the key alone and taking any
//! match attributes a flow to whoever happened to reuse that port — and a
//! wrong attacker is indistinguishable from a right one, which is worse than
//! leaving the tunnel address in place.
//!
//! This is the same trap #1771 documented for the `via_port` join, and the
//! constraint that fixes it is the one `ip_enrichment::viamap` already uses:
//! portbridge logs at *dial* time, strictly before the relayed flow can exist,
//! so a candidate dialled after the flow cannot explain it. Among those that
//! remain, the most recent opened it.
//!
//! Where no candidate survives, nothing is written. An unattributed flow is
//! honest; a confidently wrong attacker is not.
//!
//! # What it writes
//!
//!   source.ip                     the attacker, replacing the tunnel address
//!   network.relay_ip              the tunnel address, preserved
//!   network.community_id_attacker the attacker-side key, so a zeek-proxy
//!                                 record can also be joined to the VPS
//!                                 sensor's view of the same session
//!   network.relay_unresolved      set on a flow old enough that a missing
//!                                 portbridge dial is an answer rather than a
//!                                 delay: this one was never relayed. It
//!                                 records that the question was asked and
//!                                 settled, which is what stops the flow from
//!                                 being reconsidered on every later pass
//!
//! # `@timestamp` is the ingest time, not the event time
//!
//! Both indices carry an `@timestamp` that is when the record was *shipped*,
//! not when the thing happened. Measured on the live cluster: portbridge's
//! `@timestamp` runs 3-4s after its own `portbridge.time`, and zeek-proxy's
//! runs ~9.5s after `zeek.ts` for a short flow -- and **12.7 hours** after it
//! for a long-lived one, because Zeek writes a `conn.log` record when the
//! connection closes while `zeek.ts` is when it opened.
//!
//! Comparing those two ingest stamps as if they were event times breaks the
//! ordering rule below in both directions: a dial and its own flow are
//! shipped seconds apart in arbitrary order, so a valid dial is rejected for
//! appearing to happen "after" the flow it opened, and for a long connection
//! the age window is measured from a point hours away from the real one.
//! Measured cost before the fix: roughly half of every batch deferred.
//!
//! So the ordering uses event time -- `portbridge.time` and `zeek.ts` -- and
//! only the *grace* decision uses ingest time, because "has portbridge's
//! record had time to arrive yet" is genuinely a question about shipping.
//!
//! # The pipeline gets the last word on source.ip
//!
//! `geoip-honeypot` is these indices' `default_pipeline`, and a
//! `default_pipeline` runs on `_update`, not only on index. Its Zeek branch
//! derives `source.ip` from `zeek.id.orig_h`, which on zeek-proxy is always
//! the tunnel -- so it re-derived the tunnel address immediately after this
//! loop wrote the attacker, and the write appeared to succeed: ES returned
//! `"result":"updated"` with a bumped `_version` every time. Only `network.*`
//! survived, because the pipeline does not touch those fields, which made a
//! pipeline problem look like a join problem for a while.
//!
//! The pipeline now skips that assignment when `network.relay_ip` is present.
//! If this module ever stops writing that field, the pipeline will start
//! silently overwriting attacker attributions again.
//!
//! Overwriting `source.ip` rather than adding a field is deliberate: every
//! existing aggregation, filter and pivot already reads it, and the observed
//! value is not lost — Zeek's own `zeek.id.orig_h` still carries it, and
//! `network.relay_ip` records it explicitly. That field doubles as the
//! "already attributed" marker, so the write is idempotent and fully
//! reversible.
