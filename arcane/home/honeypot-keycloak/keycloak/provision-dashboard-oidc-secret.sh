# provision-dashboard-oidc-secret.sh -- a fresh --import-realm generates a
# new random client secret for apiary-dashboard (same reasoning as
# provision-events-poller.sh's own comment: no realm-JSON concept for
# pinning a client secret). Nothing ever wrote that secret to where the
# dashboard binary itself expects it
# (arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/compose.yml's OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=
# /run/dashboard-secrets/oidc-client-secret) -- sync-client-secrets.sh
# covers the *gateway* sidecars' copies on the VPS, not this one. Found
# live during #787's homeserver reinstall (2026-08-09): both dashboard and
# dashboard-b crash-looped forever on "OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET(_FILE) must
# contain at least 32 characters" because secrets/ was simply empty.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after a realm re-import (the secret file is
# simply overwritten with the current value). Both dashboard containers
# have restart: unless-stopped, so writing the file here is enough --
# no need to also restart them, their own crash-restart loop picks it up.
#
# Run on the homeserver (needs docker exec access to hp-keycloak).

# Group-own the secret by the group honeypot-dashboard's compose joins the
# container to, so dashboard-next can actually read it.
#
# The comment that used to sit here said these services "run as root:root" and
# matched ownership accordingly. That described the RETIRED Go dashboard, which
# had no USER in its Dockerfile and so bypassed file permissions entirely.
# dashboard-next runs as the frontend-next image's unprivileged `node` user
# (uid 1000), which is exactly why its compose carries a group_add -- and
# root:root 440 defeats that, because no group membership can grant read on a
# file whose group IS root. Live symptom, found after the 2026-09-03 rebuild:
#
#   [auth] /auth/login could not start sign-in:
#     Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/run/dashboard-secrets/oidc-client-secret'
#
# which the dashboard surfaces to users as "Sign-in is temporarily unavailable
# -- the identity provider or session store did not answer", pointing at
# Keycloak for what is a local file-permission problem.
