"""Regression tests for #3321: the two dashboard images must leave a
digest-bound CycloneDX SBOM behind, and the scan that grades it must be the
same pinned scan that grades every base image.

What could quietly undo this, and is therefore asserted here rather than
assumed:

* an SBOM keyed to a tag instead of the pushed digest -- an inventory of
  "whatever that tag pointed at when syft ran" answers no CVE question;
* the SBOM steps quietly applying to all 18 matrix rows, which would put a
  syft run and a Trivy advisory-DB download in front of every honeypot build
  for the sake of two images;
* the steps dropping out of the required `Containers gate`, which is the
  only reason a missing inventory is loud rather than invisible;
* a second trivy pin appearing in a workflow. That is how the base-image
  scan and the SBOM scan end up grading the same CVE two different ways,
  which is the outcome this issue was filed to prevent;
* /var/image-sbom never being provisioned, so the homeserver copy silently
  degrades to nothing on every box a #1609 rebuild creates.

The tests/docs/ CI row installs pytest and nothing else (see quality.yml),
so every PyYAML-backed assertion is paired with a dependency-free text
check, the same harness test_2639_fix.py established.
