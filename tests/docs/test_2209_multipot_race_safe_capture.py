"""Regression test for #2209: TestServeSkipsLoggingOwnHealthcheck in
arcane/home/honeypot-multipot/multipot/protocols_logging_test.go read a plain
bytes.Buffer on the main goroutine while serve()'s emitter wrote the same
buffer from its own goroutine. `go test -race ./...` flagged it; plain
`go test ./...` passed, which is why CI (quality.yml runs non-race) never saw
it.

The fix declares a sync.Mutex, routes logger.out through a writerFunc adapter
that holds the mutex for every Write, and holds the same mutex across the
read of buf.String() in the assertion. Both halves are required: locking only
the writer and reading the buffer bare still races (verified -- the detector
reports the read at buf.String() as one side of the pair).

Two layers of coverage here:

* test_go_race_detector_reports_no_race actually runs
  `go test -race -run ^TestServeSkipsLoggingOwnHealthcheck$`. That is the
  real contract, and it catches a partial fix that a text scan cannot. It
  skips when the Go toolchain or loopback networking is unavailable.
* the structural tests enforce the same contract by reading the source, so
  the regression is still caught on hosts with no Go toolchain: a mutex
  exists, logger.out is not a bare &buf, *every* access to the buffer sits
  inside a held critical section, and neither of the two behavioural
  assertions from #1677 was weakened while the race was being fixed.
