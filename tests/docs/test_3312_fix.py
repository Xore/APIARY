"""Regression test for #3312 -- Diagnostics failed every scheduled run, and
none of the failures was the condition it named.

The issue reported four things (home job): no DASHBOARD_SERVICE_TOKEN, an
OIDC discovery 403, missing libvirt sandbox networks/socket and a missing
nwfilter. #3338 checked each one live and found the reporting wrong in every
case, which is why this file exists: each of those findings was a *false*
positive about something that was fine, and a false positive about host
state is indistinguishable from a real one until someone re-reads the run. So
the diagnosis itself is the contract, and every half of it gets a check:

  metrics lane   the token was never missing. It lives in a root:root 0600
                 .env, the runner is not root, and the job's own `sed` read
                 of it failed on permission, not on an absent key. The fix is
                 a root-owned, argument-less helper the runner reaches through
                 a NOPASSWD grant, so the token never enters the job.
  OIDC           the 403 was Cloudflare answering GitHub's runner address
                 ranges; the same URL is 200 from the VPS. The probe has to
                 ask the VPS, or every scheduled run stays red on a healthy
                 endpoint.
  libvirt URI    every virsh call in the audit is bare, and a non-root
                 caller's default URI is the empty per-user session, so
                 active networks on qemu:///system read as "does not exist".
  libvirt socket monolithic libvirtd is the intended stack here, but only
                 virtproxyd was disabled in that branch, leaving the
                 preset-enabled per-driver modular sockets to win the
                 Conflicts= race after a reboot and leave libvirtd.socket
                 dead.

It also pins the last mile: the helper and its grant are host state, and a
merged PR that adds one does not put it on the box. `--helpers-only` is the
narrow path that applies them without stopping the runner service, which is
what a workflow can honestly point an operator at (and the reason this lane
was still red after #3338 merged -- the only route to the grant was a full
re-run, which stops and restarts the homeserver's Actions runner).
