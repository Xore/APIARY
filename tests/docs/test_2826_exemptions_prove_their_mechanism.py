"""Regression test for #2826's review finding: an EXEMPT reason that asserts a
mechanism must prove it.

#2826 moved /logs/hellpot, /logs/canarytokens/frontend and
/logs/canarytokens/switchboard out of KNOWN_UNCOVERED and into EXEMPT with
reasons stating, as fact, that log-maintenance.sh's copytruncate rotate() now
covers them -- and nothing checked that. Deleting both new `rotate` lines from
log-maintenance.sh left three exemptions asserting coverage that no longer
existed, and scripts/check-json-sink-retention-parity.py still exited 0. That
is the exact failure mode the script exists to end: a ledger entry is a place
to record coverage, never a place to declare it.

So EXEMPT values may now carry the mechanism as a checked key -- "rotates"
(paths the pruner's rotate() must name, attributed to the directory that
claims them) and "writer" (subtree + grep tokens, the same proof ROWS uses).
Pinned here:

1. the real tree passes (a guard that fails on everything guards nothing);
2. deleting the rotate lines the three exemptions name fails, naming them --
   the reviewer's own demonstration, run in reverse;
3. an exemption claiming a rotate line belonging to a different directory
   fails, so the claim cannot be satisfied by a neighbour's line;
4. deleting the ported rotateIfOversized fails /logs/dashboard-bff's
   exemption, which asserts a self-bounding writer rather than a rotate line.
