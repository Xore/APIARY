"""Regression test for #3310: the design lab was tracked twice.

`main` carried two trees of the same 2026-08-17 design lab:

* `branding/design-lab/` -- 12 files. #1827 (f9575d6e) preserved it, #1935
  (450c32af) added `lab.mjs` / `lab.test.mjs`. This is the canonical tree:
  `branding/` is the visual spec, `pages.yml` builds and publishes it, and
  `quality.yml` runs `lab.test.mjs` out of it in both the self-hosted and the
  GitHub-hosted lane.
* `docs/design-lab/` -- 10 files, added incidentally by the #3182 a11y PR
  (526eaf5c). It was the #1763 snapshot and had drifted: neither `lab.mjs` nor
  `lab.test.mjs`, and the weaker of the two `safePath` guards in
  `playground/compare.html` (both copies added one; the canonical one
  whitelists the path character by character and keeps `|| '/'` at every
  call site, the other resolves against an origin and drops the fallback).

It was *not* a pure duplicate, which is the part worth pinning. The `docs/`
copy had been edited since: the 2026-09-27 markdown reconciliation (b2b230cd)
gave it the redaction notice and the `design-notes.md` staleness banner, and
it carried a redaction of one captured attacker IP (`85.14.245.122` to RFC 5737
`203.0.113.122`) that `branding/` never received. That content is folded into
the canonical tree here rather than dropped -- see
`test_the_redaction_that_existed_only_in_the_duplicate_survived`.

What this file prevents is the recurrence, not the original. Three of the
tests below are deliberately path-agnostic. `SENTINELS` are basenames that
exist nowhere in the repository except the design lab, so a second copy is
caught wherever it is planted -- `docs/design-lab/` again, `branding/docs/`, a
fresh `lab/` -- rather than only at the path this issue names. A gate that
asserted nothing about `docs/design-lab` would go green the moment the fork
came back one directory over, which is the failure mode #3182 was.

Deliberately NOT asserted: that anything under the lab holds a particular
address, or that the lab is byte-stable. It is a preserved record, the
redaction is documented in the files themselves, and the two trees never were
the same bytes.

Runs under `python -m pytest tests/docs/` (quality.yml), which installs only
pytest -- so the CodeQL assertion reads YAML as text, the same trade
`tests/docs/test_3331_fix.py` makes for a workflow.
