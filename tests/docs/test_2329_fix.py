"""Regression test for #2329: OLLAMA_URL must be wired AND backend-service
must join the network that actually carries the `ollama` alias, or
/api/v1/llm-search (llm_search.rs) answers {"available": false} forever.

The pre-fix split-stack state had both halves wrong in a way that is easy
to half-fix and easy to mis-test:

* arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard-backend/compose.yml set OLLAMA_URL
  nowhere and joined backend-service to `honeynet` only, so even a
  correctly-spelled URL named a host that does not resolve from that
  container -- Docker DNS aliases are per-network, not global.
* arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/compose.yml *declared* honeypot-llm at
  top level (since #151) and attached it to no service at all. A
  declared-but-unattached network is the exact shape of this bug: the
  name is in the file, greps find it, and nothing is on it.

That second point is why this test asserts against parsed service and
network structures rather than raw file text. A whole-file
`"honeypot-llm" in text` check passes on a dangling declaration and
passes on a bare comment, so it cannot see the regression it is named
after; and the mirror-image `"honeypot-llm" not in text` over-asserts,
because these compose files are heavily commented and a comment saying
where the network went is documentation, not drift.

The contract locked in here, end to end:

1. backend-service's OLLAMA_URL is a value ollama_url() accepts. Its
   accept rules are reimplemented below (and negative-tested, so the
   helper cannot go vacuously true) instead of matching one literal
   string: `http://ollama:11434/` and the mapping form of `environment:`
   are behaviour-identical and would fail a literal match for no reason.
2. The host is `ollama` specifically. ollama_url() also accepts
   `localhost` and loopback IPs -- they clear the hardening gate and then
   resolve to the backend container itself, i.e. accepted-then-silently-
   unreachable, the failure mode #2329 already paid for once.
3. backend-service's own `networks:` list carries that network, and still
   carries `honeynet` (dashboard-next reaches it as
   http://backend-service:8081 there).
4. The backend compose declares honeypot-llm `external: true` under its
   fixed name. Non-external, Compose would stand up a *different* network
   of that name with no ollama on it -- a green `up`, a dead endpoint.
5. analysis/ghidra/docker-compose.ghidra.yml really does publish the
   `ollama` alias on that network, on the port OLLAMA_URL names. Nothing
   else checks this cross-file half; a rename there breaks semantic
   search silently.
6. The dashboard compose no longer declares the network, and neither
   compose has a dangling declaration or a service on an undeclared
   network -- the generalised form of the original bug, and of the way
   part 2 of the fix could itself have broken the stack.

Dependency note: the compose subset needed here is parsed by a small
reader in this file rather than with PyYAML. The `tests/docs/` row in
.github/workflows/quality.yml runs `pip install pytest` and nothing else,
and no other CI-run Python in this repo imports yaml -- a hard dependency
would risk a collection error taking down every file in this directory,
not just this one. When PyYAML *is* importable (it is locally), a test
below cross-checks the reader against it on the real files.
