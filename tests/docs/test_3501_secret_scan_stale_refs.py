"""Regression test for #3501: the secret-scan gate must measure the history it
was told to scan, not whatever a reused self-hosted workspace was left holding.

What #3520's CI exposed, and what could quietly undo the fix:

* `check-git-secrets.py`'s allowlist probe answers "does this entry's file
  exist in history?" with `git log --all -1 -- <path>`, and gitleaks' own
  object walk likewise starts from every ref in the repository. Both read the
  ref set, not the commit under test.
* `actions/checkout` runs `git clean -ffdx`, which removes leftover FILES and
  never stale REFS. On the reused `honeypot-ci` workspace, refs from earlier
  PRs survived, so the scan answered from a history the job was not asked to
  scan. Two clones of one IDENTICAL tree, differing only in stale
  `refs/remotes/pull/*`, measured 120 findings (62 of them in the two
  allowlisted historical paths) against 23 findings and 0 for the same tree
  without them.
* That is what made the gate report load-bearing allowlist entries as rot, and
  why `main` failed on one entry while the PR failed on two -- same tree,
  different leftover state per runner. A gate whose verdict depends on which
  box ran it is not a gate.

The fix purges the remote-tracking refs before scanning, so the scan's view of
history is the commit it was told to scan. The tests below pin that the purge
is present, that it is scoped so it cannot delete the ref actually being
checked out, and that the leftover assertion is a hard failure rather than a
silent best-effort.
