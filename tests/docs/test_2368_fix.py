"""Regression test for #2368: sync-client-secrets.sh must target exactly the
VPS oauth2-proxy gateways that actually exist in vps/docker-compose.yml.

The bug: the script's `CLIENT_CONTAINERS` map still carried two rows whose
gateway compose service had been deleted elsewhere in the repo -- `dockge`
(removed under #1185, cleanup in #2195) and `apiary-dashboard`'s
`oidc-dashboard` compat gateway (retired by #1026's follow-up). The closing

    docker compose up -d --force-recreate ${synced_containers[*]}

names every gateway on one command line, and Compose validates every named
service before recreating any of them. So a single stale row made the whole
recreate a guaranteed reject: every *valid* gateway synced its new secret to
disk and then never restarted to pick it up.

WHAT THIS TEST ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY

The failure mode is a disagreement *between files*, so asserting that the
script contains six hand-listed names proves nothing -- it only restates the
source. Every assertion below is therefore a cross-file consistency check
against `vps/docker-compose.yml`, which is the artifact that actually
rejects the run:

  * every map VALUE must be a real top-level compose service.  This is the
    #2368 failure mode itself, and it is checked on the values -- the
    pre-#2368 map had the correct KEY (`apiary-dashboard` is still a real
    realm client) and a dead VALUE (`oidc-dashboard`), so a key-only test
    cannot see the bug at all.
  * every `oidc-*` gateway in compose must appear in the map.  Guards the
    opposite drift: a newly added gateway whose secret is never rotated,
    which fails silently at the next realm rebuild rather than loudly.
  * every map KEY must match both the `${OIDC_SECRETS_DIR}/<key>` bind mount
    and the `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID` of the gateway it points at.  This ties
    the path the script writes to the path the gateway reads and the realm
    client the secret belongs to -- the three ends of the rotation.

Only the key set itself is pinned to a literal (the six clients as of
#2368), so an intentional gateway addition fails one explicit test with a
readable diff instead of silently widening the contract.

The script-internal #2195 guards are asserted by ordering rather than mere
presence: an abort that runs *after* the first write does not prevent the
half-applied state #2368 produced.

The runbook (docs/KEYCLOAK-OPERATIONS.md) is checked table-by-table against
the same map, because the issue also flagged its "8 gateways, 9 confidential
clients" counting mismatch. Whole-file substring checks are avoided
deliberately: `kibana` occurs throughout the document, so `"kibana" in text`
is true no matter what the enumeration says.
