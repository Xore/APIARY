"""Regression test for #2314: stale base-image digest pins.

golang:1.26-alpine was pinned at the 1.26.5 digest
(sha256:0178a641fbb4...) in six Dockerfiles; the moving `1.26-alpine` tag
had since rolled forward to 1.26.7 (sha256:28d89ee9cc0f...) -- two Go
patch cycles of stdlib fixes never made it into the shipped binaries.

The same sweep (docs/CONTAINER-UPDATES.md's "safe batch") also covers the
issue's "same-version digest refreshes" -- tag aliases that moved
underneath without a version change -- for python:3.14-slim,
python:3.11-slim, python:3.10-slim, python:3.12-slim, debian:bookworm-slim,
valkey/valkey:9.1.1-alpine3.24, postgres:18.6-bookworm and redis:7-alpine.

The conpot image was deliberately NOT bumped at the time: 24.04.1 existed,
but the six *_patch.py scripts hard-coded 24.04's Python site-packages
root and the build FileNotFoundErrored against it. #2619 has since lifted
that freeze -- the "restructured the package" premise turned out to be
wrong, the only real difference being the Python install root -- so the
version contract for the conpot pin now lives in
tests/docs/test_2619_fix.py, which asserts the bumped state. The conpot
tests kept below are the ones that hold whatever the pin is.

Two things the issue body got wrong, corrected here against the real repo
and a live registry query rather than trusted verbatim:

- Its per-file attribution for the python:3.10-slim and python:3.12-slim
  refreshes names honeyfs-implant/elasticpot/mailoney/tanner and
  cowrie/dicompot respectively -- but grepping the actual repo shows only
  tanner/tanner ever pinned the 3.10-slim digest, and only elasticpot (both
  stages) ever pinned the 3.12-slim one. honeyfs-implant is a Go/scratch
  build with no Python stage at all. Files are listed below as they truly
  are, not as the issue claimed.
- The issue was "registry-resolved 2026-08-26"; by the time of this fix
  (2026-08-29) python:*-slim had already rebuilt again upstream, so the
  four python digests the issue cites were themselves already stale. Per
  this repo's own docs/CONTAINER-UPDATES.md ("verify it directly, don't
  trust a secondary source"), all same-version pins were refreshed
  against a live `docker-content-digest` registry query, not copied from
  the issue text.

Three defects in the original version of this file, fixed here:

1. The repo-wide sweep used `Path.rglob` from the repo root, which
   descends into untracked sibling checkouts (`.orchestrator/worktrees/*`)
   and `node_modules`. Run from a developer checkout that has them it
   reported 162 offenders -- every one a file belonging to some other
   branch's worktree, none of them this repo's content. It only passed in
   CI by accident of a fresh clone having no such directories. The sweep
   now walks `git ls-files`, so it sees exactly the repo's tracked content
   wherever it runs.
2. The conpot freeze was asserted by string-searching the whole file for
   the literal "dtagdevsec/conpot:24.04.1" -- both too narrow (a bump to
   24.05, `latest`, or a silently dropped digest pin all sailed through)
   and too broad (it failed on a *comment* naming the tag, which is how
   the freeze was documented). Those assertions have since been removed
   rather than repaired: #2619 lifted the freeze, so pinning the image at
   24.04 became an assertion against the repo's actual contract. The
   parsed-fields approach they were rewritten into lives on in
   test_2619_fix.py, applied to the 24.04.1 pin.
3. Nothing tested the coupling that *causes* the freeze. The tests below
   now assert that every COPY'd patch script exists in the build context
   and that the RUN line executes each one -- version-agnostic couplings
   that outlived the freeze. The layout-root assertion that went with them
   moved to test_2619_fix.py, retargeted at the 3.12 root.
