"""Regression test for #2297: vps/debug-backends.sh probed a deployment
that no longer exists.

Roughly half of the script's hardcoded probe list (a static-site nginx on
8080, and a Flask / Flask+Redis / Node.js / C# ASP.NET / Go API / Rust Axum
quintet on 5000-5004/3000, plus uptime-kuma:3001 and filebrowser:8070) named
services that never exist anywhere in this repository. Those probes used
the hard `probe()` path with no tcp_open guard, so they always failed --
which meant the script's exit gate (`[[ $FAIL -eq 0 ]]`) was permanently
red no matter how healthy the real stack was. Meanwhile every gateway added
since #1062 (dashboard-next:19092, arkime:19080, revdeck:19500,
Keycloak:18080, arcane:3552) was missing, so a real outage in any of those
went undetected.

The fix reconciles the probe list against vps/traefik/dynamic.yml's own
socat-hp-* table (the actual 10.8.0.2 inventory): drops the fictional
entries, adds the missing gateways, moves the profile-gated RevDeck into
the tcp_open-guarded "expected closed" tier alongside Snare (both are only
sometimes up -- a WARN, not a FAIL, per dynamic.yml/docker-compose.yml),
and fixes the Snare remediation text to name the post-#124 project split
(snare-clone lives in honeypot-init, snare itself in honeypot-tanner).
