"""Regression test for #2137: frontend-next/public/static/theme.css is a
vendored mirror of Xore/theme's theme.css, and it had gone silently stale
-- two defect classes this project already diagnosed upstream (the #2120
literal-shadow clobber and a pre-AA-fix --accent-hover) were still
shipping in the vendored copy, and nothing in CI compared the vendored
asset against upstream, so drift was invisible.

#2471 (landed the day after this issue was filed) re-vendored theme.css to
Xore/theme@d74d519, which carries both fixes, and keyed the served
stylesheet URL by theme.lock's content hash. scripts/check-vendored-theme.sh
already hash-checks the vendored copy against theme.lock offline and, when
the network is reachable, byte-compares it against the pinned commit on
GitHub; quality.yml's vendored-theme / vendored-theme-cloud jobs already run
it on every push and pull_request. This test is the standing guard #2137
asked for at the pytest layer, independent of the shell script: it fails if
the vendored copy drifts from theme.lock, if either stale defect
reappears, or if the CI wiring that enforces this is weakened or removed.
