"""Regression tests for #3213: three credential questions, and no secret text.

The issue found that `http-honeypot` and `cisco-asa-honeypot` collapsed three
different things into one `password` field: whether a credential was present,
whether it could be parsed, and what the decoy's response meant. A request
whose body was too large to read looked identical to one that carried no
credential, and a 200 on a login page was indistinguishable from an
authentication that had actually succeeded.

The fix separates them (`credential_status`, `credential_present`,
`credential_indicator_match`, `auth_outcome`) and removes the secret itself --
not the field, the value: `body`, `query`, `data` and secret headers are
scrubbed too, because a removed field is not a removed leak.

What could quietly undo this, and is therefore asserted here rather than
assumed:

* **the twin files drifting apart.** The two sensors are separate Go modules
  with no dependency on each other, so `redaction.go` and `credentials.go`
  exist as deliberate byte-identical copies. That is exactly how a redaction
  bug is inherited: the fix lands in one module, the other keeps the old
  behaviour, and both look correct in review. Bugs found by running the built
  binaries and grepping their own emitted event streams, not by reading the
  code, are recorded here because each one is a shape a reviewer reads past:
  a field name truncated to `pass[redacted]`; a quoted JSON value bounded by
  the wrong separator so `{"password":"secret"}` leaked; a multipart part,
  whose value sits after a blank LINE and so had no separator for a
  key/value scan to act on; an HTML `name="password" value="..."` field,
  where another attribute sits between the name and the value; a form-typed
  body whose bytes are not a form, which was reported `absent` *and* stored
  verbatim; and `type="password"` read as a field name, which rewrote the
  following `name=` and walked the cursor past the real value.
* **a `password` field returning on the event**, in either module. It is
  absent from both structs today; nothing stops a later field from reintroducing
  it under a new name or an `omitempty` that a test would not notice.
* **`unknown` collapsing back into `absent`.** This is the issue's central
  distinction and the easiest to lose to a refactor that swaps a `*bool` for a
  `bool` because a nil check looked awkward.
* **an auth outcome derived from a status code.** `authReal` exists in both
  sensors and is unreachable; a future branch that sets it from `status == 200`
  would satisfy every vocabulary check in this file while reintroducing the
  exact inference the issue forbids.
* **a vendor default-credential list appearing on the ASA decoy.** A Cisco
  decoy makes `cisco123`-style bait the obvious thing to add, and it would be a
  claim about Cisco's products rather than about this fleet. The bait
  indicators are fictional and scoped to this fleet's own `nexusai-*` persona.
* **the proof being deleted rather than the bug being fixed.** Each headline
  test is named here, so removing one to make a suite green fails this file.

The `tests/docs/` CI row installs pytest and nothing else (see quality.yml), so
everything below is stdlib plus pytest, and the Go and Node suites are checked
as source rather than executed -- the two Go modules and the frontend each have
their own CI rows that run them for real.
